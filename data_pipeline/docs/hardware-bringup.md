# Hardware Bring-Up

This is the step-by-step sequence for the first real capture run with the current V1 pipeline.

Use separate terminals. For ROS-facing processes, prefer system ROS Jazzy and `/usr/bin/python3`, not Conda Python.


## Embodiment Decision

Before you record, decide which embodiment this episode belongs to:

- `lightning` only
- `thunder` only
- `lightning` + `thunder`

Recommended metadata naming:

- Lightning-only:
  - `dataset_id = spark_multisensor_lightning_v1`
  - `robot_id = spark_lightning`
- Thunder-only:
  - `dataset_id = spark_multisensor_thunder_v1`
  - `robot_id = spark_thunder`
- Bimanual:
  - `dataset_id = spark_multisensor_bimanual_v1`
  - `robot_id = spark_bimanual`

Why:

- raw bags may be recorded with one active arm or both
- published LeRobot datasets should stay profile-homogeneous
- single-arm and bimanual episodes should not be appended into the same published dataset

Current implementation note:

- the shipped default config file `data_pipeline/configs/multisensor_20hz.yaml` is still the bimanual profile
- the recorder now probes active robot-state topics and stamps the matching published profile into the raw manifest
- the converter now defaults to the manifest-selected profile when `--profile` is omitted


## 0. One-Time Setup

Run these once from the repository root:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
./data_pipeline/setup_converter_env.sh
./data_pipeline/setup_realsense_contract_runtime.sh
```


## 1. Discover Device IDs

### RealSense serial numbers

Then read the RealSense USB metadata directly:

```bash
for path in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*; do
  [ -f "$path/idVendor" ] || continue
  vendor=$(cat "$path/idVendor" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$vendor" = "8086" ]; then
    [ -f "$path/product" ] && echo "product=$(cat "$path/product")"
    [ -f "$path/serial" ] && echo "serial=$(cat "$path/serial")"
    echo "---"
  fi
done
```

Record the two serials you want to use as:

- `WRIST_SERIAL`
- `SCENE_SERIAL`

Note:

- the local `librealsense v2.54.2` runtime may report the L515 serial in shortened lowercase hex form such as `f1380660`
- the bridge now normalizes the raw USB serial and the runtime serial, so either `00000000F1380660` or `f1380660` is acceptable at launch

### GelSight device paths

List V4L camera symlinks and device names:

```bash
ls -l /dev/v4l/by-id
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```

If two GelSight devices are attached, record the two paths you want to use as:

- `LEFT_GELSIGHT_DEV`
- `RIGHT_GELSIGHT_DEV`

If only one GelSight device is attached, record just one path and launch a single tactile bridge in step 6.

If the names are ambiguous, unplug one GelSight, list again, then plug it back in and repeat.


## 2. Fill In Sensor Metadata

Copy the example file and replace the placeholder serials/calibration refs:

```bash
cp data_pipeline/configs/sensors.example.yaml data_pipeline/configs/sensors.local.yaml
```

Edit `data_pipeline/configs/sensors.local.yaml` and fill in the real values you know.

Notes:

- RealSense serial numbers are also inferred from the running node parameters.
- GelSight serial numbers are not inferred automatically, so put the real values in this file if you have them.


## 3. Start The Teleop Input Devices

If you are using SPARK, SpaceMouse, or VR inputs, start the legacy device launcher:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
.venv/bin/python TeleopSoftware/launch_devs.py
```

Leave this running.


## 4. Start The Teleop GUI / Robot Runtime

In a new terminal:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
.venv/bin/python TeleopSoftware/launch.py
```

Use the GUI to connect to the UR arms and bring the system into the control mode you want to record.

Notes:

- The current local bring-up path uses `.venv` because that environment now contains both ROS-compatible Python packages and `ur_rtde`.
- If the GUI logs `Please enable remote control on the robot!`, the dashboard connection succeeded but UR RTDE control was refused by the robot-side remote-control setting.

Expected V1 robot topics come from this process:

- `/spark/lightning/robot/joint_state`
- `/spark/lightning/robot/eef_pose`
- `/spark/lightning/robot/tcp_wrench`
- `/spark/lightning/robot/gripper_state`
- `/spark/lightning/teleop/cmd_joint_state`
- `/spark/lightning/teleop/cmd_gripper_state`
- `/spark/thunder/robot/joint_state`
- `/spark/thunder/robot/eef_pose`
- `/spark/thunder/robot/tcp_wrench`
- `/spark/thunder/robot/gripper_state`
- `/spark/thunder/teleop/cmd_joint_state`
- `/spark/thunder/teleop/cmd_gripper_state`


## 5. Start The RealSense Contract Publishers

In a new terminal:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 launch data_pipeline/launch/realsense_contract.launch.py \
  wrist_serial_no:=<WRIST_SERIAL> \
  scene_serial_no:=<SCENE_SERIAL>
```

Replace the placeholders with the serials from step 1.

Expected topics:

- `/spark/cameras/wrist/color/image_raw`
- `/spark/cameras/wrist/depth/image_rect_raw`
- `/spark/cameras/scene/color/image_raw`
- `/spark/cameras/scene/depth/image_rect_raw`

This bridge uses `pyrealsense2` directly and stamps both color and depth images with host ROS time immediately after `wait_for_frames()` returns.
The setup script builds and validates the local official `librealsense v2.54.2` runtime that is currently required for L515 support on this host.


## 6. Start The GelSight Contract Publishers

If you are using two tactile sensors, start them in another terminal:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 launch data_pipeline/launch/gelsight_contract.launch.py \
  left_device_path:=<LEFT_GELSIGHT_DEV> \
  right_device_path:=<RIGHT_GELSIGHT_DEV>
```

If you are using only one tactile sensor, launch only one side:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 launch data_pipeline/launch/gelsight_contract.launch.py \
  enable_right:=false \
  left_device_path:=<LEFT_GELSIGHT_DEV>
```

Expected topics when both are present:

- `/spark/tactile/left/color/image_raw`
- `/spark/tactile/right/color/image_raw`

If only one side is present, you should see only the enabled topic. If tactile is not ready yet, skip this step. The current published profile treats GelSight RGB as optional.


## 7. Preflight Check The Topic Surface

In a new terminal:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 topic list | rg '^/spark/'
```

Then spot-check a few topic rates:

```bash
ros2 topic hz /spark/cameras/wrist/color/image_raw
ros2 topic hz /spark/cameras/scene/color/image_raw
ros2 topic hz /spark/lightning/robot/joint_state
ros2 topic hz /spark/thunder/robot/joint_state
```

If tactile is enabled, also check:

```bash
ros2 topic hz /spark/tactile/left/color/image_raw
ros2 topic hz /spark/tactile/right/color/image_raw
```

Before recording, run the recorder dry-run:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
/usr/bin/python3 data_pipeline/record_episode.py \
  --dataset-id <dataset_id_for_this_run> \
  --task-name pick_place \
  --robot-id <robot_id_for_this_run> \
  --operator <operator_name> \
  --sensors-file data_pipeline/configs/sensors.local.yaml \
  --dry-run
```

This should print the selected topic list and should not fail with `Missing required topics`.

The dry-run output now also prints:

- `active_arms=...`
- `mapping_profile=...`
- `profile_path=...`


## 8. Record One Short Real Episode

Do one short smoke-test recording before collecting anything longer:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
/usr/bin/python3 data_pipeline/record_episode.py \
  --dataset-id <dataset_id_for_this_run> \
  --task-name pick_place \
  --robot-id <robot_id_for_this_run> \
  --operator <operator_name> \
  --sensors-file data_pipeline/configs/sensors.local.yaml
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop after a short run.

The output episode directory will be:

```text
raw_episodes/<episode_id>/
```

with:

- `bag/`
- `episode_manifest.json`
- `notes.md`


## 9. Inspect The Raw Episode

Check the bag:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 bag info raw_episodes/<episode_id>/bag
```

Check the manifest:

```bash
sed -n '1,240p' raw_episodes/<episode_id>/episode_manifest.json
```

What to look for:

- both RealSense serials are present
- the selected topic list looks complete
- `record_exit_code` is `0`
- `start_time_ns` and `end_time_ns` are populated
- sensor entries look reasonable


## 10. Convert The Episode To LeRobot

In a converter terminal:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python data_pipeline/convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py \
  raw_episodes/<episode_id> \
  --published-root published
```

Expected output includes:

- `status=pass` or `status=truncated_tail`
- `published_frames=<n>`
- `artifacts=published/<dataset_id>/meta/spark_conversion/<episode_id>`


## 11. Validate The Real Episode In The Standing Eval Path

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python data_pipeline/validate_eval_set.py \
  --work-root /tmp/pipeline_eval_real \
  --real-episode raw_episodes/<episode_id> \
  --require-real \
  --clean
```

This should leave a report at:

```text
/tmp/pipeline_eval_real/reports/evaluation_summary.json
```


## 12. If Something Fails

Use these checks first:

```bash
ros2 topic list | rg '^/spark/'
ros2 topic echo --once /spark/lightning/robot/joint_state
ros2 topic echo --once /spark/cameras/wrist/color/image_raw
ros2 topic echo --once /spark/cameras/scene/color/image_raw
ros2 param dump /spark/cameras/wrist
ros2 param dump /spark/cameras/scene
```

Common failure boundaries:

- missing required `/spark/...` topics means one of the runtime processes is not up
- RealSense failures with the official node usually mean:
  - the wrong serial number was used,
  - the upstream wrapper is not discovering that camera model on this host, or
  - the node is up but not publishing the expected image topics
- GelSight launch failures usually mean the wrong `/dev/v4l/by-id/...` path or camera access issues
- converter failures after a good bag usually point to timestamp/rate/alignment issues that should be investigated from the saved diagnostics
