# Running Notes

## 2026-03-19

### Initial setup

- Initialized git at the repo root.
- Created working branch `codex/data-pipeline-v1`.
- Added `data_pipeline/` as the home for the new collection and conversion stack.
- Wrote the first version of the V1 architecture spec in [V1_SPEC.md](C:/Users/srini/Desktop/spark/SPARK-Remote-main/data_pipeline/V1_SPEC.md).
- Cleaned temporary external research clones from the top-level `spark/` workspace after the survey phase.

### What was intentionally not changed

- Did not modify `TeleopSoftware/` yet.
- Did not remove `Hardware/` or `TeleopSoftware/`, because they are still part of the legacy runtime boundary and may be needed as topic producers or reference implementations.
- Did not add implementation code yet; only architecture and workspace scaffolding were created.

### Temporary research clones removed

- `FACTR_Teleop`
- `FastUMI_Data`
- `FFTAI_teleoperation`
- `gello_software`
- `gelsight_mini_ros2_community`
- `gsmini_community`
- `gsrobotics_legacy`
- `gsrobotics_official`
- `lerobot_realsense_ros`
- `reactive_diffusion_policy`
- `universal_manipulation_interface`

### Current working assumptions

- `main` branch runtime remains the ROS topic producer.
- `data_pipeline/` will own raw episode recording, metadata, and conversion to a published LeRobot dataset.
- One demo will map to one rosbag and one raw episode folder.
- V1 canonical clock policy is `host_capture_time_v1`.
- V1 published profile target is `multisensor_20hz`.

### Immediate next implementation steps

- Write the topic contract with explicit timestamp semantics.
- Write the dataset mapping document for raw-to-published feature rules.
- Define the first `multisensor_20hz.yaml` profile.
- Implement episode recording and conversion against the declared contracts.

### Contract files added

- Added [topic-contract.md](C:/Users/srini/Desktop/spark/SPARK-Remote-main/data_pipeline/docs/topic-contract.md).
- Added [dataset-mapping.md](C:/Users/srini/Desktop/spark/SPARK-Remote-main/data_pipeline/docs/dataset-mapping.md).
- Added [multisensor_20hz.yaml](C:/Users/srini/Desktop/spark/SPARK-Remote-main/data_pipeline/configs/multisensor_20hz.yaml).

### What these files currently lock down

- Stable V1 topic surface uses stamped standard ROS message types under `/spark/...`.
- Legacy `/lightning_*` topics are documented only as bridge inputs, not as the long-term pipeline contract.
- Published V1 schema is limited to `observation.state`, `action`, and RGB image streams.
- RealSense depth and GelSight derived outputs remain raw-only in V1.
- Alignment rules are fixed-grid at 20 Hz with explicit latest-before and nearest policies.
- `episode_manifest.json` must carry per-sensor metadata, including RealSense serial numbers, model, fps, and calibration references when available.

### Second spec pass

- Tightened the spec around small-surface-area V1 scope: one raw path, one published profile, one narrow schema, one standing eval set.
- Reworded the runtime environment rule so Conda is allowed for offline work but not required for live ROS capture.
- Added a canonical-topic rule to reduce overlapping topic aliases in the stable `/spark/...` surface.
- Added explicit bimanual stability guidance: fixed arm ordering must come from the mapping profile.
- Added standing eval-set requirements and manual spot-check expectations to the success criteria.
- Required conversion artifacts like `diagnostics.json` and effective-profile snapshots for every run.
- Refined the eval section so V1 tracks graded quality metrics, not just binary converter success.

### Lean spec pass

- Replaced the longer architecture-style spec with a shorter implementation spec.
- Kept only decisions that directly affect v1 build order, topic semantics, metadata, alignment, and diagnostics.
- Preserved the core constraints: one demo per bag, host-capture timestamp policy, `multisensor_20hz`, raw-first design, and small published schema.

### Bimanual contract pass

- Updated the topic contract so robot and teleop topics are arm-scoped for both `lightning` and `thunder`.
- Updated the dataset mapping and `multisensor_20hz.yaml` so the published profile uses a fixed arm order: `lightning` then `thunder`.
- Made the first published profile explicitly bimanual rather than leaving the arm semantics implicit.

### GitHub prep pass

- Expanded `.gitignore` for Python, ROS/colcon, editor, and dataset artifacts so the repo is easier to move between Windows and Ubuntu.
- Updated the root `README.md` to point new work toward `data_pipeline/`.

### Cleanup pass

- Removed `data_pipeline/AGENTS.md` to keep the repository from spreading intent across too many files.
- Kept the source of truth concentrated in `V1_SPEC.md`, the contract docs, the mapping YAML, and `running-notes.md`.

### Official upstream sources cloned

- Cloned `huggingface/lerobot` into the workspace so the converter can target the actual LeRobot dataset code instead of guessing its on-disk layout.
- Cloned `realsenseai/realsense-ros` and `IntelRealSense/librealsense` as the official RealSense ROS 2 wrapper and SDK sources.
- Cloned `gelsightinc/gsrobotics` as the official GelSight Mini driver/SDK reference.
- Added those checkouts to `.gitignore` so they remain local working dependencies/reference trees rather than accidental nested git repos inside this repository.

### Source integration findings

- `realsense-ros` is the correct upstream ROS 2 topic producer for RealSense and already publishes stamped image topics under its own camera namespace.
- `gsrobotics` is not a ROS package and does not publish ROS 2 topics out of the box; it is a Python SDK/demo base that still needs a thin ROS 2 wrapper for the `/spark/tactile/...` contract.
- LeRobot already contains RealSense support for direct camera access, but the V1 pipeline should still treat ROS topics and raw bags as the source of truth.

### Environment findings

- The shell default `python` points to Conda Python 3.13 in this workspace.
- ROS 2 Jazzy bindings on this machine are installed for system Python 3.12, so ROS-facing scripts must run under `/usr/bin/python3` or they will fail to import `rclpy` and `rosbag2_py`.
- That runtime split is consistent with the spec: live ROS capture should be system-ROS-native, while Conda can remain available for offline work.

### Immediate implementation direction

- Use `realsense-ros` as the upstream camera publisher base, then remap/bridge its topics into the stable `/spark/cameras/...` contract.
- Build a small ROS 2 GelSight bridge on top of `gsrobotics` to publish `/spark/tactile/{left,right}/color/image_raw` and optional raw-only derived topics with the declared timestamp semantics.
- Keep the recorder/converter under `data_pipeline/` and isolate any sensor/runtime glue from the dataset conversion logic.

### Runtime bridge implementation pass

- Added `data_pipeline/launch/realsense_contract.launch.py` to start two official RealSense ROS 2 camera nodes under the stable V1 namespace: `/spark/cameras/wrist/...` and `/spark/cameras/scene/...`.
- Added `data_pipeline/gelsight_bridge.py` as a ROS 2 node that publishes `/spark/tactile/{left,right}/color/image_raw` from the official `gsrobotics` camera path using host ROS time immediately after frame capture.
- Added `data_pipeline/launch/gelsight_contract.launch.py` to start left and right GelSight bridge processes with explicit device-path or device-index arguments.

### Teleop hardware-tuning sync pass

- Compared the current `TeleopSoftware/` runtime against the hardware-tested `SPARK-Remote-data_collection` branch and ported the teleop-side calibration deltas without removing the newer stamped `/spark/...` publishers.
- Updated arm ordering in `TeleopSoftware/launch.py` to `Lightning` then `Thunder`, matching the tested branch and the published fixed-arm ordering already used by the data pipeline profile.
- Replaced the generic degree-based UR home positions with the measured radian home values from the tested branch.
- Added the legacy `/{arm}_spark_command_angles` and `/{arm}_spark_command_gripper` publishers back into `TeleopSoftware/launch.py` so the legacy raw topic surface matches the tested hardware branch alongside the stable stamped topics.
- Ported the tested Spark-to-UR offset tables, trigger calibration ranges, and Lightning visualization transform into `TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/run.py`.
- Updated `TeleopSoftware/UR/arms.py` so `enable_grippers` can be either a boolean or a per-arm map, matching the tested branch structure without breaking the existing call sites.
- Intentionally left the shared `lightning_spark_enable` gating unchanged because the current hardware uses one foot pedal to gate both arms through the Lightning enable topic; this sync pass preserved that tested control semantics.

### Teleop bring-up findings

- The host system Python had `rclpy` but did not have `ur_rtde`; the existing Conda interpreters had the opposite problem and could not load the ROS 2 Jazzy bindings.
- Installed `ur_rtde` only into the local `.venv`, which already had working ROS bindings, so the current non-actuating Teleop bring-up path is `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && .venv/bin/python TeleopSoftware/launch.py`.
- Live launch testing showed both robot dashboards are reachable, but RTDE control is refused until remote control is enabled on the robot side.
- The Teleop GUI previously crashed in the main loop if an arm failed RTDE initialization because `ros_update()` always dereferenced `URs.get_receive(arm)`.
- Patched `TeleopSoftware/UR/arms.py` and `TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/run.py` so the GUI stays up and continues advertising the expected raw and stamped topics even when RTDE receive interfaces are missing.
- Verified live topic advertisement from `/gui_node` after the crash fix:
  - `/lightning_spark_command_angles`
  - `/lightning_spark_command_gripper`
  - `/thunder_spark_command_angles`
  - `/thunder_spark_command_gripper`
  - `/spark/lightning/robot/*`
  - `/spark/lightning/teleop/*`
  - `/spark/thunder/robot/*`
  - `/spark/thunder/teleop/*`

### RealSense timestamp caveat

- Reading the official `realsense-ros` source showed that its published image stamps are derived from RealSense frame timestamps rather than the exact `host_capture_time_v1` rule declared in the V1 topic contract.
- The current launch file is still useful for getting the ROS 2 topic names, types, and camera process boundary aligned with the contract.
- We still need one follow-up pass for RealSense timestamp semantics: either patch the local wrapper checkout or replace it with a small SDK-based publisher that stamps frames immediately after `wait_for_frames()` returns.

### Validation notes

- `gelsight_bridge.py` imports and CLI parsing were validated under `/usr/bin/python3`.
- Both launch files were syntax-checked and validated with `ros2 launch ... --show-args`.
- The official `gsrobotics` camera helper imports `cv2.typing`, which is not available in the system OpenCV build here, so the ROS bridge uses a small local OpenCV capture wrapper while still reusing the official image-processing path.

### Raw-layer implementation pass

- Added `data_pipeline/pipeline_utils.py` for shared profile loading, topic selection, manifest writing, topic-type discovery, and sensor metadata helpers.
- Added `data_pipeline/record_episode.py` as the first live recorder CLI. It resolves the `/spark/...` topic set from the profile, snapshots topic types, creates the raw episode folder, seeds `episode_manifest.json` and `notes.md`, and then runs `ros2 bag record`.
- Added `data_pipeline/generate_dummy_episode.py` to write a synthetic rosbag plus matching manifest and notes in the same episode-folder shape expected by V1.
- Added `data_pipeline/__init__.py` so the scripts can be imported as a package and still run directly from the repository checkout.

### Raw-layer validation

- `record_episode.py` and `generate_dummy_episode.py` both passed `py_compile` and CLI help validation under `/usr/bin/python3`.
- `generate_dummy_episode.py` was run successfully against a temporary output root and produced:
  - `bag/bag_0.db3`
  - `bag/metadata.yaml`
  - `episode_manifest.json`
  - `notes.md`
- `ros2 bag info` on the generated dummy bag showed the expected bimanual robot, command, RealSense, and optional GelSight topics with plausible message counts and timestamps.

### Converter environment note

- The system ROS Python runtime on this machine does not currently have `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `datasets`, or `torch`.
- That means the next converter pass should either:
  - run in a dedicated offline environment that has the LeRobot dataset stack installed, or
  - start with a dependency-light alignment/diagnostics pass before wiring in final LeRobot export.

### Offline converter environment pass

- Added `data_pipeline/requirements-converter.txt` as a focused dependency set for rosbag reading and LeRobot dataset export.
- Added `data_pipeline/setup_converter_env.sh` to bootstrap the offline environment reproducibly from the repository root.
- Chose a system-Python 3.12 virtual environment with `--system-site-packages` as the baseline because it keeps `rosbag2_py` and `rclpy` compatible with the installed ROS 2 Jazzy runtime.
- The host is missing `python3.12-venv`, so the bootstrap script falls back to `virtualenv` when the stdlib `venv` path cannot seed pip.

### GPU environment decision

- Initially tested a CPU-only Torch path to keep the environment lighter.
- Switched to GPU-enabled Torch after confirming the machine has discrete GPUs and enough disk headroom to absorb the bundled CUDA runtime wheels.
- The final environment keeps the live ROS tooling on system Python and uses `.venv` only for offline conversion and LeRobot-facing work.

### Offline environment validation

- Bootstrapped `.venv` successfully with:
  - LeRobot installed editable from the local `lerobot/` checkout
  - `torch 2.6.0+cu124`
  - `torchvision 0.21.0`
  - `scipy 1.17.1`
- Verified that the same interpreter can import all of:
  - `rosbag2_py`
  - `rclpy`
  - `lerobot.datasets.lerobot_dataset`
  - `scipy`
  - `torch`
- Verified GPU visibility inside `.venv`:
  - CUDA available: `True`
  - device count: `2`
  - first device reported as `NVIDIA RTX A5500`

### Offline converter implementation pass

- Added `data_pipeline/convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py` as the first real raw-bag-to-LeRobot converter for the `multisensor_20hz` profile.
- The converter reads one raw episode folder, loads the manifest and profile, forms the published 20 Hz time grid, aligns state and action with `latest_before`, aligns RGB image streams with `nearest`, and writes one episode into a LeRobot dataset under `published/<dataset_id>/`.
- Conversion artifacts are written per episode under `published/<dataset_id>/meta/spark_conversion/<episode_id>/`:
  - `diagnostics.json`
  - `conversion_summary.json`
  - `effective_profile.yaml`
- Raw-only topics are still read for diagnostics, but only the published image topics are decoded into RGB frame payloads. This avoids coupling the converter to raw-only depth or derived topic encodings.
- Existing LeRobot dataset feature sets are treated as immutable. If a later episode would change the published schema for the same `dataset_id`, conversion should fail rather than silently mutate the dataset contract.

### Converter integration note

- The current LeRobot `add_frame()` path rejects a caller-supplied `timestamp` field during frame validation even though the dataset stores a default timestamp column.
- The converter therefore lets LeRobot synthesize the timestamp column from `frame_index / fps`, which still matches the fixed published 20 Hz grid declared in the spec.

### Converter validation

- `convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py` passed `py_compile` inside `.venv`.
- Converted the tactile-inclusive dummy episode at `/tmp/pipeline_dummy_test_run/episode-test` into `published/dummy_multisensor_v1`:
  - status: `pass`
  - published frames: `10`
  - selected image fields: wrist, scene, gelsight left, gelsight right
- Converted an RGB-only dummy episode at `/tmp/pipeline_dummy_rgbonly/episode-rgbonly` into `published/dummy_multisensor_rgbonly_v1`:
  - status: `pass`
  - published frames: `10`
  - selected image fields: wrist, scene
- Validated dataset append by converting `/tmp/pipeline_dummy_append/episode-append-a` and `/tmp/pipeline_dummy_append/episode-append-b` into the same dataset root:
  - reloaded dataset reported `2` episodes and `20` frames
  - the second conversion artifact recorded `dataset_episode_index = 1`
- Inspected the emitted diagnostics and confirmed that raw-only RealSense depth topics still appear in `topic_diagnostics` with counts and observed rates even though they are not part of the published schema.

## 2026-03-20

### Single-arm vs bimanual profile decision

- Hardware bring-up made the profile boundary concrete: the raw capture path should tolerate either one active arm or two active arms, but the published LeRobot datasets should remain embodiment-specific.
- Rejected the idea of zero-filling the inactive arm into the bimanual schema by default. The storage overhead would be tiny, but the semantic cost would be high because it would mix single-arm and bimanual behavior in one dataset contract.
- Locked in the intended published split:
  - `multisensor_20hz`
    - current bimanual profile
  - `multisensor_20hz_lightning`
    - planned Lightning-only profile
  - `multisensor_20hz_thunder`
    - planned Thunder-only profile
- Added the corresponding documentation rule: one `dataset_id` should contain episodes from exactly one published profile.
- Preserved the current bimanual `multisensor_20hz.yaml` config, but documented that it should now be treated explicitly as the bimanual published profile rather than the universal raw-capture shape.

### Implementation consequence

- The next pipeline change should separate raw-capture topic selection from published-profile selection.
- Raw recording should record the available `/spark/...` topic surface and store active-arm metadata.
- Published conversion should choose the matching embodiment profile and write into the corresponding dataset instead of padding into a larger schema.

### Profile-split implementation pass

- Added `data_pipeline/configs/multisensor_20hz_lightning.yaml` and `data_pipeline/configs/multisensor_20hz_thunder.yaml` as the single-arm published profiles alongside the existing bimanual `multisensor_20hz.yaml`.
- Extended `data_pipeline/pipeline_utils.py` with active-arm normalization, active-arm probing from live `/spark/{arm}/robot/joint_state` messages, and published-profile resolution based on the detected embodiment.
- Updated `data_pipeline/record_episode.py` so `--active-arms auto` now probes which robot-state topics are actually producing messages, resolves the matching published profile, and records `active_arms` plus the selected `mapping_profile` in the raw manifest.
- Updated `data_pipeline/convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py` so omitting `--profile` now means "use the manifest-selected profile", and conversion validates `active_arms` against the loaded profile instead of assuming the bimanual default.
- Updated `data_pipeline/generate_dummy_episode.py` so dummy bags honor the selected profile's active arms, which keeps eval and schema validation meaningful for both single-arm and bimanual cases.
- Updated `data_pipeline/validate_eval_set.py` so real-episode validation can use the manifest-selected profile automatically instead of forcing the bimanual default.

### Validation

- `py_compile` passed for:
  - `pipeline_utils.py`
  - `record_episode.py`
  - `convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py`
  - `generate_dummy_episode.py`
  - `validate_eval_set.py`
- Re-ran dummy conversion for the bimanual profile:
  - dataset feature shapes remained `observation.state=(38,)`, `action=(14,)`
- Ran a Lightning-only dummy conversion without passing `--profile` to the converter:
  - manifest recorded `mapping_profile=multisensor_20hz_lightning`
  - dataset feature shapes were `observation.state=(19,)`, `action=(7,)`

### Runtime stamped-topic pass

- Patched `TeleopSoftware/launch.py` and `TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/run.py` so the existing live runtime now publishes the stable stamped robot-state topics directly:
  - `/spark/{arm}/robot/joint_state`
  - `/spark/{arm}/robot/eef_pose`
  - `/spark/{arm}/robot/tcp_wrench`
  - `/spark/{arm}/robot/gripper_state`
- Those stamped state topics are emitted from the same control/update loop that already publishes the legacy unstamped topics, and they reuse a single `control_tick_time_v1` stamp per arm iteration.
- Added stamped command publishing for the Spark joint-control path at the actual `servoJ`/gripper issue point:
  - `/spark/{arm}/teleop/cmd_joint_state`
  - `/spark/{arm}/teleop/cmd_gripper_state`
- This keeps the pipeline consumer side decoupled from legacy topic schemas while giving the live runtime a real stable `/spark/...` surface.

### Runtime scope caveat

- The stable robot-state topics are now emitted continuously from the Teleop runtime loop.
- The stable command topics are currently wired for the Spark joint-control path, because that is where the actual joint command vector and derived gripper command are available in this codebase.
- Other control modes in `TeleopSoftware` still do not publish a V1-compatible joint-command topic, so the current `multisensor_20hz` action contract should still be treated as Spark-mode-first until those modes are either instrumented or split into a different published profile.

### Minimal eval path

- Added `data_pipeline/validate_eval_set.py` as a small standing-eval driver for V1.
- The eval script can:
  - generate the canonical dummy tactile episode,
  - convert it into an isolated published root,
  - optionally convert one or more user-supplied real raw episodes,
  - reload the resulting LeRobot datasets, and
  - write one machine-readable summary to `reports/evaluation_summary.json`.
- Validated the dummy-only path with:
  - `.venv/bin/python data_pipeline/validate_eval_set.py --work-root /tmp/pipeline_eval_test --clean`
- That run completed successfully and produced:
  - `entries = 1`
  - `failures = 0`
  - a published eval dataset under `/tmp/pipeline_eval_test/published/eval_dummy_multisensor_v1`
  - an eval report at `/tmp/pipeline_eval_test/reports/evaluation_summary.json`
- The script intentionally keeps the real-episode check optional unless `--require-real` is passed, so the dummy path can run in CI or on development machines without attached hardware while still supporting the standing real-episode check once one is recorded.

### RealSense timestamp resolution pass

- Revisited the RealSense timestamp problem after the offline converter and eval path were stable.
- Confirmed again from the official `realsense-ros` source that the wrapper computes image header stamps from RealSense frame timestamps and time-base conversion logic rather than from immediate host ROS time at frame acquisition.
- Tried the narrowest official-wrapper path first:
  - patched the local `realsense-ros` checkout to support a host-capture-time mode,
  - built `realsense2_camera_msgs` successfully under system Python,
  - installed missing host packages needed for wrapper and SDK work:
    - `ros-jazzy-diagnostic-updater`
    - `librealsense2`
    - `librealsense2-dev`
- That wrapper build still failed against the available SDK on this machine because the current upstream `ros2-master` wrapper expects newer librealsense APIs and stream types such as safety, occupancy, and labeled point cloud that are not present in the installed 2.56.5 SDK surface.

### Final RealSense runtime decision

- Replaced the contract launch dependency on `realsense-ros` with an in-repository ROS 2 package built directly against the official `librealsense2` SDK:
  - `data_pipeline/ros2/spark_realsense_bridge/`
- Added `spark_realsense_bridge` as a small dedicated ROS 2 node that:
  - opens one RealSense by explicit serial number,
  - publishes `color/image_raw` and optional `depth/image_rect_raw`,
  - stamps both streams with `node->now()` immediately after `pipeline.wait_for_frames()` returns,
  - preserves the same stamp across the color and depth pair from the same frameset, and
  - exposes profile and device identity as ROS parameters so the existing manifest metadata helper can still infer camera serial and model information.
- Updated `data_pipeline/launch/realsense_contract.launch.py` so it now launches two instances of this bridge under:
  - `/spark/cameras/wrist`
  - `/spark/cameras/scene`
- Added `data_pipeline/setup_realsense_contract_runtime.sh` to build the package into `install/spark_realsense_bridge`.

### RealSense bridge validation

- Built the custom package successfully with:
  - `./data_pipeline/setup_realsense_contract_runtime.sh`
- Verified the built package is visible to ROS:
  - `ros2 pkg prefix spark_realsense_bridge`
- Verified the launch file interface under the built overlay:
  - `ros2 launch data_pipeline/launch/realsense_contract.launch.py --show-args`
- Did not run a live camera acquisition test in this turn because no RealSense devices were attached to validate against.

### Workflow documentation pass

- Added `data_pipeline/configs/sensors.example.yaml` so the `--sensors-file` path in `record_episode.py` has a concrete starting template for inventory serials and calibration references.
- Added `data_pipeline/README.md` as a minimal operator runbook covering:
  - environment setup,
  - RealSense bridge build,
  - contract sensor launch using the existing per-sensor entrypoints,
  - raw recording,
  - single-episode conversion, and
  - standing eval usage.
- Updated the repository root `README.md` so the data-pipeline section now points readers to the new runbook first instead of only the spec and notes.
- Deliberately did not keep extra orchestration or batch-conversion wrappers before hardware validation; the runtime surface remains the existing recorder, converter, eval script, and per-sensor launch entrypoints.

### Hardware bring-up doc pass

- Added `data_pipeline/docs/hardware-bringup.md` as the explicit first-real-run checklist.
- Kept that guide procedural and narrow:
  - one-time environment setup,
  - device-ID discovery,
  - Teleop runtime bring-up,
  - RealSense and GelSight contract launch,
  - recorder dry-run,
  - short smoke-test recording,
  - bag and manifest inspection,
  - offline conversion, and
  - standing real-episode eval.
- Updated `data_pipeline/README.md` to point directly to the new hardware bring-up guide.

### RealSense hardware-debug pass

- On this machine, the immediate RealSense blocker was lower than ROS:
  - both cameras showed up in `lsusb`,
  - but their USB video interfaces were initially unbound from `uvcvideo`,
  - so neither the custom bridge nor the ROS-packaged wrapper could see working devices.
- Confirmed this by inspecting `lsusb -t`, which showed the RealSense video interfaces as `Driver=[none]` while GelSight was already bound to `uvcvideo`.
- Added `data_pipeline/bind_realsense_uvc.sh` as the repeatable hardware-bootstrap step that binds unclaimed RealSense video interfaces to `uvcvideo`.
- After binding:
  - `/dev/video*` nodes appeared for both the L515 and the D405,
  - `/dev/v4l/by-id/` gained stable RealSense symlinks,
  - `v4l2-ctl --list-devices` showed both cameras,
  - and `rs-enumerate-devices` started seeing the D405.

### Official RealSense runtime correction

- Re-checked the official `realsense2_camera` path from a clean local source tree and from the distro-installed ROS package.
- The official wrapper already publishes `/color/metadata` and `/depth/metadata` topics whose JSON payload includes:
  - `clock_domain`
  - `frame_timestamp`
  - `time_of_arrival`
  - `backend_timestamp`
  - `hw_timestamp`
- Live D405 probing showed the stock wrapper currently stamps `Image.header.stamp` from `frame_timestamp` rather than `time_of_arrival`.
- Live D405 probing also showed that this distro wrapper publishes the color topic as `color/image_rect_raw`, so the V1 launch wrapper now remaps that private topic to the stable contract name `color/image_raw`.
- Measured one live D405 sample and confirmed:
  - `header.stamp == frame_timestamp`
  - `time_of_arrival` trails by a small positive delta on this host
- Updated the V1 converter so that when the official RealSense metadata topics are present in the bag, the corresponding RealSense image series uses `time_of_arrival` for alignment instead of the wrapper header stamp.
- Updated the published profile so the recorder keeps these official metadata topics in the raw bag:
  - `/spark/cameras/wrist/color/metadata`
  - `/spark/cameras/wrist/depth/metadata`
  - `/spark/cameras/scene/color/metadata`
  - `/spark/cameras/scene/depth/metadata`

### L515 limitation on this host

- The current upstream `realsense-ros` line removed L500/L515 support starting in `4.55.1`; this is documented in the upstream changelog.
- The distro-installed ROS wrapper on this machine is `realsense2_camera v4.56.4`, so it is already on the post-L500-removal line.
- Stock probing with:
  - `ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py ... serial_no:=_00000000F1380660`
  - and `rs-enumerate-devices -s`
  still sees only the D405 and not the L515.
- A previous `realsense-viewer --debug` log that looked like "2 RealSense devices" turned out to be misleading:
  - one of the two device paths was actually the attached GelSight USB camera path, not the L515 path
  - so that log should not be interpreted as proof that the stock ROS/runtime stack can currently use the L515 on this host
- Current practical state:
  - official ROS path for D405 wrist camera: usable
  - official ROS path for L515 scene camera: still blocked on this host
  - converter-side timestamp semantics for official RealSense metadata: implemented

### Runtime cleanup after the official-path switch

- Removed the abandoned active fallback artifacts from the current working tree:
  - `data_pipeline/ros2/spark_realsense_bridge/`
  - `data_pipeline/v4l_camera_bridge.py`
  - `data_pipeline/launch/realsense_v4l_contract.launch.py`
  - `data_pipeline/bind_realsense_uvc.sh`
- Older notes above that mention those pieces are retained as historical debug context only; they are no longer the intended V1 runtime path.
- The custom C++ `spark_realsense_bridge` is still not usable:
  - it segfaults during ROS FastDDS participant creation before camera startup,
  - and the currently installed system `librealsense2` exports embedded FastDDS symbols, which is the leading conflict hypothesis.
- The ROS-packaged `realsense2_camera` node became usable for the D405 after the manual UVC bind, but the current L515 path is still not clean in that wrapper on this host.
- Added `data_pipeline/v4l_camera_bridge.py` and `data_pipeline/launch/realsense_v4l_contract.launch.py` as the smallest working RGB-only fallback so hardware recording can proceed for the required published color streams while the SDK/depth path is still unresolved.

### Direct SDK RealSense pivot

- Revisited the legacy Teleop camera path and confirmed it uses `pyrealsense2` directly rather than the ROS `realsense2_camera` wrapper.
- Based on that and the current upstream L500/L515 support gap, switched the intended V1 RealSense runtime back to a single direct-SDK stack for all RealSense cameras.
- Added `data_pipeline/realsense_bridge.py` as a small ROS2 publisher that:
  - connects to one device by serial using `pyrealsense2`,
  - publishes `/spark/cameras/<name>/color/image_raw`,
  - publishes `/spark/cameras/<name>/depth/image_rect_raw` when enabled,
  - stamps both streams with host ROS time immediately after `wait_for_frames()` returns,
  - and exposes serial/model/firmware/profile parameters so the episode manifest can still infer camera metadata.
- Updated `data_pipeline/launch/realsense_contract.launch.py` to launch one bridge process per configured camera from `.venv/bin/python`.
- Updated `data_pipeline/setup_realsense_contract_runtime.sh` to validate the direct `.venv` runtime instead of checking for `realsense2_camera`.
- Added `pyrealsense2==2.56.5.9235` to the shared `.venv` bootstrap so the RealSense publisher and offline converter use the same ROS-friendly Python environment.
- Removed the RealSense metadata topics from the active recording profile because the direct bridge now produces the correct V1 header stamps directly.
- Kept converter support for older bags that already contain official RealSense metadata topics.
- Current direct-SDK discovery state on this host:
  - `pyrealsense2` in `.venv` sees the D405,
  - the L515 is visible to `lsusb` and `/dev/v4l/by-id`,
  - but `pyrealsense2` still does not enumerate the L515 in the current session,
  - so full two-camera hardware validation still depends on the live L515 state at bring-up time.
- Live D405 validation of the new bridge passed:
  - `ros2 launch data_pipeline/launch/realsense_contract.launch.py wrist_serial_no:=130322273305`
  - published `/spark/cameras/wrist/color/image_raw`
  - published `/spark/cameras/wrist/depth/image_rect_raw`
  - `ros2 param dump /spark/cameras/wrist` exposed serial/model/firmware/profile
  - `ros2 topic hz /spark/cameras/wrist/color/image_raw` stabilized at about 30 Hz
- Differential hardware check after adding a D455 showed:
  - D405 and D455 enumerate in the installed `pyrealsense2` / `rs-enumerate-devices`
  - L515 does not
  - the failure follows the L515 across ports, so it is not a hub-port issue
- Built an isolated official `librealsense v2.54.2` runtime with Python bindings against `.venv`, using `FORCE_RSUSB_BACKEND=ON`.
- Validated that the locally built `pyrealsense2` from `build/librealsense-v2.54.2/Release` enumerates:
  - D455 `213622251272`
  - D405 `130322273305`
  - L515 `f1380660`
- Updated the RealSense setup/launch path so the bridge now uses that local `v2.54.2` runtime instead of the installed `2.56.x` module.
- Added serial normalization in the bridge so the physical USB serial and the SDK-reported short L515 serial both resolve to the same device.
- Live validation of the final target pair passed:
  - D405 wrist `130322273305`
  - L515 scene `f1380660`
  - both published their contract topics at roughly 30 Hz through the local `v2.54.2` runtime
- Three-camera stress check also passed when the D455 was launched on a temporary non-contract namespace:
  - D405 on `/spark/cameras/wrist/...`
  - L515 on `/spark/cameras/scene/...`
  - D455 on `/spark/cameras_aux/extra/...`
  - all three color streams produced stamped `sensor_msgs/Image` samples concurrently

### Raw sensor identity decision

- The current published profile names like `wrist`, `scene`, `left`, and `right` are too narrow to treat as long-term raw identity.
- The raw episode manifest should preserve enough information to remap old episodes later without recollecting data.
- The chosen compromise is:
  - keep the current runtime topic surface for now,
  - enrich each manifest sensor record with stable raw identity fields,
  - and let published profiles map those raw sensor identities into dataset field names.
- Final lean per-sensor manifest fields:
  - `sensor_id`
  - `modality`
  - `attached_to`
  - `mount_site`
  - `topic_names`
  - `serial_number`
  - `model`
  - `calibration_ref`
- Added top-level manifest field:
  - `sensor_inventory_version`
- `sensors.example.yaml` is now the place where the operator can remove ambiguity for the current rig by filling in fields such as:
  - `attached_to: lightning`
  - `mount_site: finger_left`
- This keeps the current runtime conservative while making the raw layer explicit enough to support later renaming or profile changes, without carrying debug-style per-episode sensor clutter.

### Episode language field

- Added an optional `language_instruction` field to the raw episode manifest.
- This is intentionally episode-level only for now.
- `task_name` remains the stable internal task identifier.
- During conversion, published LeRobot `task` now prefers `language_instruction` and falls back to `task_name` if no instruction was supplied.
- This keeps the change low-complexity while preserving a clean path for future language-conditioned training.

### March 20 hardware bring-up and first real episode

- Brought up a real Lightning-only hardware stack successfully with:
  - `TeleopSoftware/launch_devs.py`
  - `TeleopSoftware/launch.py`
  - `data_pipeline/launch/realsense_contract.launch.py`
- Live dry-run succeeded once the active camera serials were corrected for the current session:
  - wrist camera: D405 `130322273305`
  - scene camera: D455 `213622251272`
- The first real raw episode recorded successfully:
  - `raw_episodes/episode-20260320-110232`
  - `dataset_id=spark_multisensor_lightning_v1`
  - `mapping_profile=multisensor_20hz_lightning`
  - duration about `49s`
  - bag size about `4.2 GiB`
- Bag review showed the core arm trajectory data was healthy:
  - both RGB and depth streams recorded for wrist and scene cameras at about 30 Hz
  - robot state recorded at about 121 Hz
  - teleop joint command stream recorded at about 28 Hz
- Bag review also exposed a real gripper problem:
  - `/spark/lightning/teleop/cmd_gripper_state` stayed constant at `1.0`
  - `/spark/lightning/robot/gripper_state` stayed constant at `228.0`
  - joint motion was still present, so the problem was isolated to the gripper path
- Root cause was a Lightning trigger calibration mismatch in `TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/run.py`.
  - The current pipeline copy was using the wrong Lightning Spark trigger mapping range.
  - Updated Lightning gripper calibration to match `SPARK-Remote`:
    - `in_min=-0.4`
    - `in_max=0.25`
- Found one additional remaining hardware-tuning mismatch against `SPARK-Remote` and corrected it:
  - updated `LIGHTNING_OFFSET` in `TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/run.py` to the tested branch values
- Left the hardcoded `enable_topic = 'lightning_spark_enable'` unchanged for now because the current setup uses a single foot pedal wired through Lightning.

### Real episode conversion and local LeRobot visualizer

- Converted the first real raw episode to LeRobot format:
  - input: `raw_episodes/episode-20260320-110232`
  - output: `published/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1`
  - converter reported:
    - `episode_index=0`
    - `status=truncated_tail`
    - `published_frames=898`
- Verified the published dataset layout is LeRobot `v3.0` compatible:
  - `meta/info.json`
  - `meta/episodes/chunk-000/...`
  - `data/chunk-000/file-000.parquet`
  - `videos/observation.images.wrist/...`
  - `videos/observation.images.scene/...`
- Cloned the official browser visualizer repo locally:
  - `lerobot-dataset-visualizer`
- Found a real local-viewer bug during bring-up:
  - the client-side browser code ignored `DATASET_URL`
  - it fell back to `https://huggingface.co/datasets/...`
  - for the local dataset path `local/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1`, this produced a `401`
- Verified the failure directly with Playwright using the system Chrome:
  - the failing request was:
    - `https://huggingface.co/datasets/local/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1/resolve/main/meta/info.json`
- Patched `lerobot-dataset-visualizer/src/utils/versionUtils.ts` locally so browser-side fetches use a public/same-origin dataset base instead of silently falling back to Hugging Face.
- Rebuilt the visualizer and re-verified with Playwright:
  - the dataset page now loads successfully
  - both wrist and scene videos render
  - language instruction renders
  - charts render
  - remaining 404s are only optional progress files:
    - `sarm_progress.parquet`
    - `srm_progress.parquet`
- Verified working viewer URL for this machine context:
  - `http://10.33.55.65:3000/local/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1/episode_0`
- Important operational note:
  - for this IDE/browser environment, `localhost:3000` is not the reliable access path
  - use the machine IP URL above instead

### Machine-specific command runbook

- Added a concrete machine-specific runbook at `data_pipeline/docs/current-lightning-gelsight-runbook.md`.
- Scope of that runbook is intentionally narrow:
  - `lightning` only
  - D405 wrist + D455 scene
  - one left GelSight
  - raw record -> convert -> browser visualizer
- Linked that runbook from:
  - `data_pipeline/README.md`
  - `data_pipeline/docs/hardware-bringup.md`
- Purpose is operational clarity during bring-up, not to replace the more general hardware guide.

### SPARK identity and launcher fixes

- Found a real long-term SPARK identity problem:
  - `Hardware/Firmware/SparkSerialTX/src/main.cpp` in both this repo and `SPARK-Remote` hardcoded `doc["ID"] = "lightning"`.
  - That means the repo state itself does not encode distinct Lightning vs Thunder firmware identities.
- Added a proper firmware-level fix:
  - `SPARK_DEVICE_ID` compile-time macro in `SparkSerialTX`
  - PlatformIO envs for:
    - `esp32doit-devkit-v1` -> Lightning
    - `esp32doit-devkit-v1-thunder` -> Thunder
- Added a launcher-side guard in `TeleopSoftware/launch_devs.py`:
  - probes each Spark device ID before spawning child nodes
  - refuses to launch duplicate firmware IDs silently
  - prints an explicit reflash message instead of allowing GUI flicker/corruption
- Also fixed `launch_devs.py` to spawn child processes with `sys.executable` instead of plain `python3`, so it stays on the intended interpreter.

### SPARK firmware now fixed on hardware

- Verified directly from raw serial JSON that both physical SPARK boards were initially reporting `ID=lightning`.
- Flashed the physical SPARK boards into a known symmetric state:
  - `/dev/ttyUSB0` -> `lightning`
  - `/dev/ttyUSB1` -> `thunder`
- Re-verified from raw serial JSON after flashing:
  - both boards report all encoder `status` bits as `true`
  - the firmware IDs are now distinct at the hardware source
- Because hardware identity is now correct, removed the duplicate-ID skip/probe behavior from `TeleopSoftware/launch_devs.py`.
- Kept the useful runtime fixes:
  - `launch_devs.py` still uses `sys.executable`
  - `SparkNode.py` now tolerates ESP32 boot chatter / delayed first JSON packet instead of crashing at startup

### Recorder simplification: explicit active arms

- Removed `--active-arms auto` from `data_pipeline/record_episode.py`.
- Recording now requires an explicit embodiment declaration:
  - `--active-arms lightning`
  - `--active-arms thunder`
  - `--active-arms lightning,thunder`
- Reason:
  - the auto-detection path introduced avoidable hardware flakiness during bring-up
  - explicit active-arm selection is simpler and more reliable for real collection
- Removed the now-unused active-arm probe helpers from `data_pipeline/pipeline_utils.py`.

### Capture/runtime split for RealSense

- Confirmed the stable machine boundary is:
  - live capture: system ROS Python `/usr/bin/python3`
  - offline conversion / LeRobot: local `.venv`
- Reason:
  - `lerobot` requires Python `>=3.12`
  - the stable local RealSense runtime on this host is the official `librealsense v2.54.2` build wired into system ROS Python
  - mixing both into one environment created repeated `pyrealsense2` packaging and enumeration failures
- Updated `data_pipeline/launch/realsense_contract.launch.py` so the RealSense bridge now launches with `/usr/bin/python3`, not `.venv/bin/python`.
- Updated `data_pipeline/setup_realsense_contract_runtime.sh` so it now builds the local `pyrealsense2` binding for system Python and validates imports without relying on `query_devices()`.
- Kept the earlier `data_pipeline/realsense_bridge.py` fix that removes upfront `query_devices()` dependence and instead canonicalizes the provided serials before per-camera startup.

### Operator Console spec pass

- Added `data_pipeline/docs/operator-console-spec.md` as the contract for the planned lab-facing capture GUI.
- Kept the boundary explicit:
  - the Operator Console is separate from `TeleopSoftware/launch.py`
  - Teleop remains untouched in V1
- Wrote the console spec in the same contract-oriented style as `data_pipeline/V1_SPEC.md`:
  - explicit goal
  - boundary
  - runtime base
  - readiness contract
  - workflow state model
  - metadata / record / convert contracts
  - acceptance criteria
- Linked the new spec from `data_pipeline/README.md`.

### Operator Console Phase 1 skeleton

- Added the first separate Operator Console implementation:
  - `data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`
  - `data_pipeline/configs/operator_console_presets.yaml`
- Kept the Teleop boundary intact:
  - the console launches or stops the existing Teleop processes
  - it does not modify `TeleopSoftware/launch.py`
- Current Phase 1 scope of the implementation:
  - preset selection
  - metadata form
  - process orchestration for SPARK, Teleop, RealSense, GelSight, recorder, and converter
  - subsystem health cards
  - validate / record / convert / open-viewer actions
  - per-process log view
- The first prototype is intentionally operational rather than polished.
- Added `.operator_console/` to `.gitignore` because the backend now persists local session state there.

### Operator Console runtime validation pass

- Validated the new console backend against the real Lightning runtime by driving the backend directly, not just opening the Tk window.
- The first backend run exposed a real design issue:
  - continuous health polling was using `ros2 topic echo --once`
  - that made healthy services look dead or too slow during startup
- Split the health model into two layers:
  - lightweight continuous health cards
  - stronger stream probes only during `Validate`
- Added startup grace handling for:
  - SPARK
  - Teleop
  - RealSense
  - GelSight
- Updated session-state behavior:
  - if a required subsystem is truly red, the session now transitions to `degraded`
  - otherwise startup remains `bringing_up`
- Added process-log hints into degraded health cards so the operator can see the latest actionable failure without opening a shell immediately.
- Real runtime result with the current `lightning_d405_d455_left_gelsight` preset:
  - SPARK: healthy
  - Teleop: healthy
  - RealSense: healthy
  - GelSight: red / degraded
  - `Validate` failed for the real reason:
    - timed out waiting for `/spark/tactile/left/color/image_raw`
  - the health card also surfaced the underlying launch failure for the GelSight bridge process

### Operator Console readiness-model correction

- Follow-up observation from real use:
  - the earlier backend run was not a full success signal because the robot was not actually turned on
  - and the active preset incorrectly assumed a connected GelSight when the tactile device was absent
- Adjusted the console accordingly:
  - added a `lightning_d405_d455_no_tactile` preset so the default path does not flag a missing GelSight unnecessarily
  - restored representative message-flow probes for continuous health, but with caching and startup grace instead of probing every refresh cycle
  - kept the stronger end-to-end stream probe in `Validate`
- Result:
  - GelSight can now be removed from the required set cleanly by preset
  - Teleop and SPARK no longer become green purely from process spawn plus topic presence
  - the console health model is closer to "runtime up vs actually validated" instead of collapsing those into one signal

### Operator Console explicit validation state and per-process controls

- Continued the console without changing the overall layout:
  - added explicit validation-state reporting in the header
  - added per-card Start/Stop controls for the existing subsystem cards
- Backend changes:
  - added `validation_state(config)` with explicit states:
    - `not_run`
    - `running`
    - `passed`
    - `failed`
    - `stale`
  - added `start_named_process(...)` and `stop_named_process(...)` so the UI can restart one subsystem without tearing down the whole session
  - made validation re-entrant safe by ignoring duplicate validate clicks while a validation thread is already running
- UI changes:
  - header now shows both session state and validation state
  - subsystem cards now expose lightweight Start/Stop controls
  - recorder controls now respect the explicit validation state rather than only the old boolean flag
- Smoke validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - `timeout 5s python3 data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - both passed without Tk/runtime errors

### Operator Console button-state tightening

- Followed up immediately on the first controls pass to make the UI harder to misuse:
  - `Start Session` now disables once the session is already up or bringing up
  - `Stop Session` disables when nothing session-level is active
  - `Validate` disables while a validation run is already in progress
- Also mirrored the current session state and validation state into the Action Output pane so operators do not have to infer them only from the header or button enablement.
- Re-ran the same smoke checks:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - `timeout 5s python3 data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### Operator Console ROS-native stream probe

- Replaced the console's representative-message probe path:
  - removed reliance on `ros2 topic echo --once` for health and validate checks
  - added `data_pipeline/ros_topic_probe.py`, a small ROS-native one-shot subscriber probe using `rclpy`
- Wired the backend health cache and `Validate` path to use that probe instead of the slower CLI echo path.
- Reason:
  - the CLI echo path was producing repeated false negatives on image and startup-sensitive topics
  - that made healthy SPARK and RealSense services stay yellow even after they were actually streaming
- Real backend validation result with the full `lightning_d405_d455_left_gelsight` preset:
  - SPARK: healthy
  - Teleop: healthy
  - RealSense: healthy
  - GelSight: healthy
  - session state reached `ready_for_dry_run`
  - `Validate` passed and reported the expected `11` bag topics for the Lightning+tactile configuration
- Important nuance from the logs:
  - the Teleop process still emitted an early Tk callback traceback around gripper activation
  - but by the end of the probe window the required Lightning robot and teleop topics were flowing, so the console correctly treated Teleop as healthy for readiness purposes

### Operator Console recording integrity check

- Ran a short end-to-end console smoke recording with a dedicated smoke dataset id to exercise:
  - `Start Session`
  - `Validate`
  - `Start Recording`
  - `Stop Recording`
- Result:
  - the recorder lifecycle worked and wrote a real raw episode directory plus bag metadata
  - but the recorded bag had `0` messages for:
    - `/spark/lightning/teleop/cmd_joint_state`
    - `/spark/lightning/teleop/cmd_gripper_state`
  - which is exactly the failure mode you would get if an operator forgets to actually start teleop execution after recording begins
- Added a post-stop recording integrity check in the console backend:
  - parses `raw_episodes/<episode_id>/bag/metadata.yaml`
  - verifies every required recorded topic for the chosen config has a nonzero message count
  - surfaces failure through:
    - `latest_recording_check_output`
    - `last_action_error`
    - recorder health card turns red with a concise missing-topic summary
  - `Convert Latest` is now disabled when the last recording failed this integrity check
- Validated the new behavior directly against the known-bad smoke episode:
  - recorder health becomes `Last recording incomplete`
  - the two zero-message teleop command topics are surfaced explicitly

### Converter runtime fix

- Hit a separate usability bug while converting a real episode from shell:
  - running `.venv/bin/python data_pipeline/convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py ...` without ROS sourced fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: rosbag2_py`
- Confirmed this is only a shell/runtime issue:
  - `.venv` can import `rosbag2_py` correctly once `/opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash` is sourced
- Fixed the console and docs accordingly:
  - `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py` now sources ROS before launching `convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py`
  - updated conversion command examples in:
    - `data_pipeline/README.md`
    - `data_pipeline/docs/hardware-bringup.md`
    - `data_pipeline/docs/current-lightning-gelsight-runbook.md`
- Re-tested conversion on `episode-20260320-232548` with ROS sourced:
  - the `rosbag2_py` import issue is gone
  - conversion now fails for the real data reason:
    - missing required teleop command topics `/spark/lightning/teleop/cmd_joint_state` and `/spark/lightning/teleop/cmd_gripper_state`

### Profile-driven bounded action hold

- Investigated the newer tactile episodes and separated two different failure modes:
  - `episode-20260320-232548`
    - still invalid because the teleop command topics were missing entirely
  - `episode-20260320-234600`
    - command topics were present and dense overall
    - conversion failed only because of two isolated mid-episode command gaps, with the worst gap around `135 ms`
- Verified an important semantic point before changing anything:
  - the converter already discards pre-roll before the first action sample
  - so this was not caused by starting the recorder before pressing the foot pedal
- Implemented the pipeline fix in `data_pipeline/convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py`:
  - removed the old hard-coded `STATE_AGE_NS`, `ACTION_AGE_NS`, and `IMAGE_SKEW_NS` assumptions
  - converter now reads:
    - `published.observation_state.max_age_ms`
    - `published.action.max_age_ms`
    - per-image `max_skew_ms`
    directly from the profile
  - kept the same `latest_before` semantics for state and action, which is already a bounded zero-order hold
  - added minimal action-hold diagnostics:
    - `max_action_age_ms`
    - `num_frames_over_50ms`
    - `num_frames_over_100ms`
- Updated `data_pipeline/configs/multisensor_20hz_lightning.yaml`:
  - `action.max_age_ms` is now `150`
  - state and image tolerances remain strict
- Validation result after the change:
  - `episode-20260320-232443` still fails
    - first failure now at `157.36 ms`, so the older clearly-bad episode is still rejected
  - `episode-20260320-234600` now converts successfully
    - `status=pass`
    - `published_frames=386`

### Tactile dataset id split

- The successful bounded-hold conversion exposed a schema issue:
  - tactile episodes were still being pointed at `spark_multisensor_lightning_v1`
  - that dataset had already been created without `observation.images.gelsight_left`
  - so LeRobot correctly rejected the append due to feature mismatch
- Fixed the checked-in defaults:
  - `data_pipeline/configs/operator_console_presets.yaml`
    - `lightning_d405_d455_left_gelsight` now defaults to `spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1`
  - `data_pipeline/docs/current-lightning-gelsight-runbook.md`
    - updated record/convert/viewer examples to the tactile dataset id
  - `data_pipeline/docs/hardware-bringup.md`
    - clarified that tactile and non-tactile episodes should not share one published `dataset_id`
- Added a converter escape hatch for already-recorded episodes:
  - `--published-dataset-id`
  - this allows re-targeting conversion without manually editing the raw manifest
- Updated the console conversion path so `Convert Latest` uses the current preset dataset id as the published dataset target.
- Verified end to end:
  - `episode-20260320-234600` converted successfully with:
    - `--published-dataset-id spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1`
  - output:
    - `published/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1`
    - `episode_index=1`

### Recorder card action clarity

- Tightened one operator-console usability issue in `data_pipeline/operator_console.py`:
  - the recorder health card could say `Last recording ready for conversion`
  - but still showed generic `Start` / `Stop` buttons
  - which made it easy for an operator to press `Start` expecting conversion and accidentally begin a new recording
- Fixed the recorder card so its controls now follow recorder state instead of staying generic:
  - while recording:
    - `Record` disabled
    - `Stop` enabled
  - when the latest recording is ready for conversion:
    - `Convert` enabled
    - `Record New` offered as the secondary action
  - otherwise:
    - `Record`
    - `Stop` disabled
- Tightened the global `Convert Latest` button to enable only when the latest recording has explicitly passed the post-stop integrity check, instead of allowing the intermediate `unknown` state.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console.py data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`
  - `timeout 5s python3 data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### Console conversion command assembly fix

- Found a real operator-console bug in `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`:
  - when the current preset provided a `dataset_id`, the backend built the conversion shell command with
    `--published-dataset-id ...--published-root ...`
    as one concatenated token
  - the symptom at runtime was the exact argparse failure:
    `error: unrecognized arguments: /home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/published`
- Fixed `_build_convert_command(...)` to assemble the converter invocation from an argument list and join it once, instead of relying on fragile string concatenation.
- Validation:
  - printed the generated command for `episode-20260321-001038`
  - confirmed it now contains:
    - `--published-dataset-id spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1`
    - `--published-root /home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/published`
    as separate flags
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### Recorder controls deduplicated

- Removed the duplicate recording/conversion controls from the top-level Session form in `data_pipeline/operator_console.py`.
- Reason:
  - after the recorder card became state-aware, the UI had two separate control surfaces for the same recorder actions:
    - recorder card `Record` / `Stop` / `Convert`
    - global `Start Recording` / `Stop Recording` / `Convert Latest`
  - that duplication was unnecessary and made the UI harder to trust
- New boundary:
  - Session form now owns only session-level actions:
    - `Start Session`
    - `Stop Session`
    - `Validate`
    - `Open Viewer`
  - Recorder card owns recorder-level actions:
    - `Record`
    - `Stop`
    - `Convert`
    - `Record New`
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console.py data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`
  - `timeout 5s python3 data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### Viewer action resilience

- Found a separate Operator Console weakness around `Open Viewer`:
  - the button state depended too heavily on the console's in-memory `latest_dataset_id`
  - so if a dataset already existed on disk, or conversion happened outside the current console process, the viewer action could be unavailable or misleading
- Tightened the viewer path in `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py` and `data_pipeline/operator_console.py`:
  - `Open Viewer` now resolves the target dataset from disk, preferring the current form `dataset_id` and falling back to the console's latest known dataset
  - the button now enables when a valid `published/<dataset_id>/meta/info.json` exists for the current config, not only when the current session memory has `latest_dataset_id`
  - on Linux, the backend now uses `xdg-open` when available, with `webbrowser.open(...)` as fallback
- Runtime diagnosis from the latest check:
  - the generated URL was correct:
    - `http://10.33.55.65:3000/local/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1/episode_2`
  - the actual reason it failed was simpler:
    - no viewer server was running on port `3000`
- Brought the viewer back up with:
  - `cd /home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/lerobot-dataset-visualizer`
  - `env -u http_proxy -u https_proxy -u HTTP_PROXY -u HTTPS_PROXY -u ALL_PROXY -u all_proxy -u NO_PROXY -u no_proxy NEXT_PUBLIC_DATASET_URL=http://10.33.55.65:3000/datasets DATASET_URL=http://localhost:3000/datasets REPO_ID=local/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1 EPISODES=2 ~/.bun/bin/bun start`
- Validation after bring-up:
  - `curl` with proxy vars stripped returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` for:
    - `http://localhost:3000/`
    - `http://10.33.55.65:3000/`
  - the specific episode route returned HTML successfully:
    - `http://localhost:3000/local/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1/episode_2`

### Open Viewer now owns viewer startup

- Tightened the Operator Console contract for `Open Viewer`:
  - the user should not be expected to manually start `lerobot-dataset-visualizer`
  - pressing `Open Viewer` should ensure the server exists, then open the episode URL
- Implemented this in `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`:
  - added an on-demand managed process: `viewer_server`
  - `open_viewer(...)` now:
    - resolves the dataset and latest episode from `published/<dataset_id>/meta/info.json`
    - starts `lerobot-dataset-visualizer` automatically if the configured viewer base URL is not already reachable
    - waits for the server to come up
    - then opens the URL with `xdg-open` on Linux
- `data_pipeline/operator_console.py` now enables `Open Viewer` whenever the current config points at a dataset that exists on disk, rather than depending on in-memory conversion state.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - backend probe on the tactile dataset returned:
    - `available=True`
    - target URL `http://10.33.55.65:3000/local/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1/episode_2`
    - `reachable=True`
  - `timeout 5s python3 data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### Viewer launch path simplified

- After the viewer-startup fix, revisited the browser-launch code in `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`.
- Kept the code minimal:
  - removed the extra `webbrowser.open(...)` fallback path
  - kept only the Linux-native `xdg-open` launch path that this machine already has
- Reason:
  - for the actual incident, the root cause was that the server was not running
  - the browser-launch fallback was not part of the required fix
  - keeping both launch paths only added unnecessary branching
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - viewer target resolution for the tactile dataset still returns:
    - `('spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1', 2, 'http://10.33.55.65:3000/local/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_v1/episode_2')`

### Recorder post-stop analyzing state

- Fixed a small but misleading recorder-card transition in the Operator Console:
  - after `Stop`, the recorder process would exit immediately
  - then the post-stop integrity check would run
  - during that gap the UI briefly fell back to the default `Record` state before changing to `Convert` / `Record New`
- Added an explicit backend flag `recording_check_running` in `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`.
- The recorder health card now reports:
  - `Analyzing last recording`
  while the post-stop bag integrity check is still running.
- The recorder card buttons in `data_pipeline/operator_console.py` now show a neutral disabled state during that window:
  - `Analyzing`
  - `Wait`
- This keeps the UI honest and removes the brief flash of the wrong next action.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - `timeout 5s python3 data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### Recorder analyzing-state transition fix

- Follow-up to the previous recorder analyzing-state change:
  - the first version still let one UI refresh slip through with the default `Record` state
  - reason: `recording_check_running` was being set inside `_finalize_recording_after_exit(...)`, after the recorder process had already been marked `stopped`
- Fixed the transition point in `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`:
  - the backend now sets `recording_check_running = True` immediately after the recorder subprocess exits successfully, before flipping the visible recorder state to `stopped`
- This is a timing correction, not a new state-model change.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### Recorder and converter split into separate tiles

- Simplified the Operator Console interaction model after the recorder-state churn became too complicated:
  - the recorder card no longer changes into a conversion card
  - conversion is now represented as its own separate health/action tile directly under the recorder
- `data_pipeline/operator_console.py` changes:
  - Session form now stays focused on session-level actions only
  - health tiles now include a dedicated `converter` card
  - recorder card is back to a simpler responsibility:
    - `Record`
    - `Stop`
    - with the temporary `Analyzing` handoff after stop
  - converter card now owns conversion/review actions:
    - `Convert`
    - `Stop` while converting
    - `Open Viewer` once a published dataset exists
- `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py` changes:
  - added a dedicated converter health card summary
  - recorder summary now says `Last recording complete` instead of implying conversion belongs there
- Also tightened session-button state so the top bar does not treat an in-progress conversion as idle.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - `timeout 5s python3 data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### SPARK health simplification

- Follow-up simplification after reviewing the semantics of the SPARK health check:
  - removed `/Spark_enable/{arm}` from the SPARK sample-topic requirement
  - kept it only in the required-topic presence list
- Reason:
  - the useful part of the previous fix was the shorter probe cache and recovery hold
  - using `Spark_enable` as an additional liveness sample made the rule harder to explain without adding real value for alignment readiness
- Current SPARK behavior is now:
  - required topics:
    - `/Spark_angle/{arm}`
    - `/Spark_enable/{arm}`
  - readiness sample:
    - `/Spark_angle/{arm}` only
  - plus:
    - `0.5s` sample cache TTL
    - `3s` recovery hold before returning to green
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### SPARK static-stream detection

- Rechecked the live failure case directly instead of guessing from the health card:
  - `/Spark_angle/lightning` was publishing at about `28-30 Hz`
  - but a direct sample probe showed the angle vector was completely unchanged across 12 messages
  - that explains the observed behavior:
    - SPARK card could report `healthy`
    - while the Spark GUI itself did not move
- Implemented a Spark-specific dynamic probe path:
  - extended `data_pipeline/ros_topic_probe.py` with optional support for:
    - `--min-messages`
    - `--require-float-array-change`
    - `--min-max-delta`
  - added cached `Float32MultiArray` change detection in `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`
  - SPARK health now uses this only after the normal liveness check passes
- New SPARK card behavior:
  - green:
    - topics present
    - messages flowing
    - angle vector changes over a short sample window
  - yellow:
    - `SPARK Devices live but static`
    - when the stream is publishing but the angle vector is unchanged
  - red:
    - missing topics or dead stream
- This keeps the health card honest without pretending it knows whether the operator is pressing the pedal.
- Validation:
  - `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && /usr/bin/python3 data_pipeline/ros_topic_probe.py --topic /Spark_angle/lightning --topic-type std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray --timeout 1.0 --min-messages 8 --require-float-array-change --min-max-delta 1e-6`
    returned `rc:1` on the current bad static stream
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/ros_topic_probe.py data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`
  - `timeout 5s python3 data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### SPARK health-model correction

- Removed the earlier SPARK-specific cache-shortening and recovery-hold behavior.
- Reason:
  - after rechecking the live failure, that was not the real problem
  - the real issue was a static Spark angle stream, not a transient health-card flicker problem
- Final SPARK model is now simpler again:
  - required topics:
    - `/Spark_angle/{arm}`
    - `/Spark_enable/{arm}`
  - liveness sample:
    - `/Spark_angle/{arm}`
  - dynamic-state check:
    - if the angle stream is alive but unchanged over a short sampled window, show:
      - `SPARK Devices live but static`
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/ros_topic_probe.py data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console.py`

### Operator Console frontend decision

- Updated `data_pipeline/docs/operator-console-spec.md` to make the frontend choice explicit instead of leaving it open-ended.
- New decision:
  - production Operator Console frontend should be `PySide6` / Qt
  - it remains a local Python desktop app
  - it must not become a browser/server app
- Also clarified the migration rule:
  - the current Tk console is a prototype/reference only
  - Qt migration must preserve the same backend supervisor, process model, readiness gates, and operator workflow

### Qt frontend implementation start

- Added a separate Qt frontend implementation at:
  - `data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`
- Kept the migration boundary clean:
  - reused the existing `OperatorConsoleBackend`
  - did not change process orchestration or readiness semantics as part of the frontend switch
  - left the Tk prototype in place as a fallback/reference during the transition
- Added a minimal frontend dependency file:
  - `data_pipeline/requirements-operator-console.txt`
- Updated `data_pipeline/README.md` so the preferred launch path is now the Qt frontend, with the Tk launcher still documented as a fallback.
- Installed `PySide6` into the local `.venv` for verification.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`
  - `source .venv/bin/activate && QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen timeout 5s python data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`
  - result:
    - the Qt frontend starts and stays up for the smoke window
    - only the expected offscreen-plugin `propagateSizeHints()` warnings appeared

### Qt X11 dependency fix

- The first real desktop launch of `data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py` failed on this Ubuntu/X11 machine with:
  - `Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb"`
  - Qt explicitly pointed at the missing runtime package:
    - `libxcb-cursor0`
- Installed the missing system dependency:
  - `sudo apt-get install -y libxcb-cursor0`
- Re-tested the real X11 launch:
  - `source .venv/bin/activate && timeout 5s python data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`
  - result:
    - no Qt plugin crash
    - process stays up for the timeout window
- Added the Ubuntu/X11 dependency note to `data_pipeline/README.md`.

### Spec cleanup after frontend decision

- Removed the now-resolved frontend-toolkit question from `data_pipeline/docs/operator-console-spec.md`.
- The spec already names Qt / `PySide6` as the chosen production frontend, so leaving `Tk vs Qt vs local web app?` in the open-questions list was no longer accurate.

### Qt scroll fix for smaller screens

- Verified on a real desktop screenshot that the initial Qt layout clipped the lower health cards and left the `Converter` tile below the fold with no practical access path.
- Wrapped the left session form column and the center subsystem-health column in vertical `QScrollArea`s.
- Re-tested on the desktop:
  - the `Converter` tile is now reachable without resizing the window or depending on a taller monitor
  - the right-side logs/output column remains fixed-height and does not scroll with the forms/cards

### Viewer stale-process fix

- Traced a false `Episode 3 not found in metadata` viewer error to a stale viewer server process:
  - the published dataset on disk contained `episode_index=3`
  - but the running viewer process was not being restarted when `Open Viewer` targeted a newer dataset/episode
- Fixed `data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py` so `Open Viewer` no longer returns early just because `:3000` is reachable.
- The backend now checks whether the currently managed viewer process matches the desired dataset/episode command and restarts it when the target changes.

### Minimal tactile provenance in raw manifests

- Revisited what tactile metadata is actually meaningful to preserve if the goal is:
  - keep only the source tactile image in the bag
  - avoid storing derived depth / marker / slip products
  - still make later reprocessing defensible
- Tightened the scope to only runtime-available provenance from the current GelSight bridge:
  - `device_path` / `device_index`
  - `frame_id`
  - `encoding`
  - `fps`
  - `capture_width` / `capture_height`
  - `output_width` / `output_height`
  - preprocessing summary:
    - `pipeline`
    - `border_fraction`
    - `crop_applied`
- Added these fields to the raw manifest inference path by declaring them as ROS params in `data_pipeline/gelsight_bridge.py` and reading them in `data_pipeline/pipeline_utils.py`.
- Updated `data_pipeline/V1_SPEC.md` to state that this tactile provenance extension is intentionally narrow and should not be replaced with fake calibration placeholders or derived tactile outputs.
- Updated `data_pipeline/configs/sensors.example.yaml` to show `gel_type` as an explicit manual inventory field (`marker` vs `plain`).

### Raw bag storage migration to MCAP

- Wrote down the storage decision in `data_pipeline/docs/raw-storage.md`:
  - raw episode bags should default to `mcap`
  - use `zstd_fast`
  - keep the raw layer lossless
  - do not conflate this with any published-depth design decision
- Updated the checked-in recorder defaults in `data_pipeline/record_episode.py`:
  - `--storage-id` now defaults to `mcap`
  - added `--storage-preset-profile`, defaulting to `zstd_fast`
  - when using MCAP, `ros2 bag record` now receives `--storage-preset-profile zstd_fast`
  - raw manifests now stamp:
    - `bag_storage_id`
    - `bag_storage_preset_profile`
- Added shared helpers in `data_pipeline/pipeline_utils.py`:
  - `read_bag_metadata(...)`
  - `detect_bag_storage_id(...)`
- Removed the old sqlite-only assumption from `data_pipeline/convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py`:
  - conversion now reads `bag/metadata.yaml`
  - detects `storage_identifier`
  - opens the bag with the correct backend instead of hardcoding `sqlite3`
  - conversion artifacts now also stamp `bag_storage_id`
- Updated `data_pipeline/generate_dummy_episode.py` to follow the same storage defaults and stamp the same manifest fields.
- Validation:
  - generated a synthetic raw episode at:
    - `/tmp/pipeline_mcap_eval/raw/episode-mcap-test`
  - verified the raw bag is really MCAP:
    - `bag/metadata.yaml` reports `storage_identifier: mcap`
    - the bag file is `bag_0.mcap`
  - converted that MCAP episode successfully with the normal converter path:
    - output dataset:
      - `/tmp/pipeline_mcap_eval/published/dummy_mcap_eval`
    - conversion summary reports:
      - `bag_storage_id: mcap`
      - `status: pass`

### Qt log focus and artifact copyability

- Tightened two small but real Qt usability gaps in `data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`:
  - action handlers now automatically switch the `Process Logs` selector to the relevant process:
    - `Start Session` -> `spark_devices`
    - `Record` / `Stop` -> `recorder`
    - `Convert` -> `converter`
    - `Open Viewer` -> `viewer_server`
    - per-card `Start` / `Stop` buttons also focus that process
  - the `Latest Artifacts` values are now mouse-selectable text, so operators can copy:
    - episode id
    - dataset id
    - viewer URL
- This keeps the interaction model simple:
  - the right-hand panes remain the same
  - but the UI now jumps to the likely log stream instead of making the operator select it manually

### Qt terminal Ctrl-C handling

- The first Qt frontend pass only shut down cleanly through the window close path.
- Pressing `Ctrl+C` in the launching terminal did not reliably stop the app, which was a regression from the Tk prototype.
- Fixed `data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py` by:
  - installing explicit `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` handlers that call `app.quit()`
  - adding a small no-op `QTimer` signal pump so Python signal delivery is serviced while the Qt event loop is running
- Result:
  - the Qt app can now be terminated from the terminal with `Ctrl+C`
  - backend cleanup still goes through the normal window/application shutdown path

### Qt frontend reset to v1 composition

- Backed out the experimental parallel `v2` frontend after reviewing the composition more critically.
- Reworked the main `data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py` instead of introducing more parallel UIs.
- The revised direction keeps the original three-column hierarchy:
  - left:
    - `Preset & Task`
    - `Sensor Inputs`
    - `Session Actions`
    - `Latest Artifacts`
  - middle:
    - full-height `Subsystem Health`
  - right:
    - `Selected Process`
    - `Process Logs`
    - `Action Output`
- Visual changes stayed frontend-only:
  - calmer header band
  - compact semantic status chips on cards instead of showing raw color words
  - neutral cards with stronger typography and less colored chrome
  - clearer separation of task setup versus sensor inputs
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`
  - `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen timeout 5s python data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`
  - app starts and stays up for the smoke window with only the expected offscreen Qt warning

### Removed the oversized Qt title band

- The big `Operator Console` title band was not adding operational value and was taking vertical space away from the real workflow.
- Removed it from `data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`.

### Removed duplicate Qt state row

- The slim replacement state row also turned out to be redundant because `Action Output` already shows:
  - `Session state`
  - `Validation state`
- Removed that top row too, so the UI now starts immediately with the three working columns.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`
  - `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen timeout 5s python data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`

### Screenshot-driven Qt cleanup

- Stopped relying only on code inspection for frontend changes and rendered the actual Qt window offscreen to inspect the composition directly.
- The screenshot made two layout problems obvious:
  - low-signal optional fields were pushing `Latest Artifacts` down the left column
  - the right column was giving too much height to `Action Output` relative to `Process Logs`
- Tightened the Qt UI accordingly in `data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`:
  - rebalanced the right column so logs get more height than output
  - tightened subsystem card padding slightly so more cards fit comfortably in the middle column
  - capped the command preview height so the `Selected Process` box stays compact
- After reviewing the rendered result again, backed out the `Show Advanced` toggle:
  - for only `Notes` and `Extra Topics`, the extra reveal control was more UI than value
  - kept those two fields inline in a small `Optional` section instead
- Re-rendered the window after the change and confirmed:
  - `Latest Artifacts` is visible in the default 1080p composition
  - the default view reads more like an operator workflow and less like a config dump

### Qt combo box text overlap fix

- A screenshot review caught a real styling bug in the Qt frontend:
  - combo-box selected text was being covered by a white subcontrol area
  - this was most visible in the `Preset` field
- Root cause:
  - the custom stylesheet was forcing `QComboBox` too far away from the native control rendering
- Fixed it narrowly in `data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py` by:
  - dropping the custom combo-box chrome rules
  - keeping only the popup list styling
- Re-rendered the UI afterward and confirmed:
  - selected combo-box text is visible
  - the native arrow is back
  - the white overlay bug is gone

### Raw bag head/tail trim by teleop command activity

- After validating MCAP on real hardware, the next storage win was not another container change; it was obvious idle time at the beginning and end of raw recordings.
- For real episodes like `episode-20260321-120141`, the published usable interval started much later than raw recording start because the teleop command topics only began once the operator actually started driving:
  - raw recording began first
  - `/spark/lightning/teleop/cmd_*` started later
  - converter therefore published only the overlap window
- Chose a narrow raw-trim policy for storage reduction:
  - basis: first and last teleop command topic activity
  - no dependency on foot-pedal state
  - do not split on mid-episode command gaps
  - apply a small fixed pad before and after the active window
- Implemented this in `data_pipeline/record_episode.py` as a post-record rewrite of the just-recorded bag:
  - default pad before: `1.0 s`
  - default pad after: `1.0 s`
  - default behavior: enabled after successful recording
  - opt-out flag: `--disable-command-trim`
- The recorder now stamps the result into `episode_manifest.json` under `capture.raw_trim`, including:
  - activity topics used
  - pad values
  - status
  - whether trimming was applied
  - pre/post message counts
  - pre/post bag sizes
  - bag/activity/trim timestamp bounds
- Updated the storage contract in `data_pipeline/docs/raw-storage.md`:
  - MCAP + `zstd_fast` remains the raw storage default
  - automatic head/tail trimming is now part of the raw storage policy
  - mid-episode pauses are explicitly not split by this step

### Published depth storage spec

- Did a deeper pass on adding depth to the published dataset rather than only to raw bags.
- Confirmed the current local LeRobot path is not the right place to force depth through today:
  - `video_utils.py` currently marks `video.is_depth_map = False`
  - `image_writer.py` still assumes 3-channel image writing
- Wrote `data_pipeline/docs/depth-storage.md` as a narrow storage contract instead of jumping straight to implementation.
- The chosen direction is:
  - keep the current LeRobot RGB/state/action dataset unchanged
  - add RealSense depth as a lossless published sidecar
  - store depth payloads as 16-bit grayscale PNG bytes inside chunked parquet shards
  - avoid a private LeRobot core fork in this step
- Explicitly left out of first scope:
  - GelSight derived depth
  - viewer support
  - training-loader integration
  - custom LeRobot feature types

### Published depth sidecar implementation

- Implemented the first converter-side depth export slice without changing the core LeRobot RGB/state/action dataset path.
- Added `published_depth` declarations to the main published profiles:
  - `multisensor_20hz`
  - `multisensor_20hz_lightning`
  - `multisensor_20hz_thunder`
- The converter now:
  - aligns RealSense depth to the same published frame grid as RGB/state/action
  - applies field-level nearest-frame skew checks for depth
  - fails conversion if published depth cannot align cleanly
  - writes lossless depth sidecars under `published/<dataset_id>/depth/`
  - writes `meta/depth_info.json`
- To avoid loading whole raw depth streams into memory, the converter uses a two-pass approach:
  - first pass: timestamps for all topics, values only for the main published streams
  - second pass: decode only the selected aligned depth samples
- Validation:
  - `python -m py_compile data_pipeline/convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py`
  - synthetic episode conversion emitted:
    - `depth/observation.depth.wrist/chunk-000/file-000.parquet`
    - `depth/observation.depth.scene/chunk-000/file-000.parquet`
    - `meta/depth_info.json`
  - real MCAP episode `episode-20260321-120141` converted successfully into a throwaway dataset root with depth sidecars
- Observed real-episode depth sidecar sizes for `episode-20260321-120141`:
  - wrist depth parquet: about `30.9 MB`
  - scene depth parquet: about `22.1 MB`
  - total dataset root with RGB + state/action + depth sidecars: about `51 MB`

### Depth viewer support

- Extended the local `lerobot-dataset-visualizer` episode path to detect the optional `meta/depth_info.json` sidecar contract and build per-episode depth parquet URLs.
- Added a `DepthStreamViewer` component that:
  - reads aligned depth sidecar parquet files
  - keeps the lossless `png16_bytes` sidecar format unchanged on disk
  - loads only the current depth frame preview on demand instead of decoding every depth image up front
  - decodes depth PNG bytes browser-side and renders a colorized preview, following the same general idea as `realsense-viewer` rather than trying to display raw 16-bit depth directly
  - renders wrist and scene depth alongside the normal episode videos
  - follows the shared playback clock instead of introducing a separate timeline
- Important implementation detail:
  - `hyparquet` needed `utf8: false` for `BYTE_ARRAY` reads, otherwise the binary PNG payload was coerced into strings and corrupted before decode
- Validation:
  - `bun run type-check` in `lerobot-dataset-visualizer`
  - `bunx --bun next build` in `lerobot-dataset-visualizer`
  - Playwright screenshot/DOM check against the real dataset route:
    - `local/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_depth_eval/episode_0`
    - confirmed both depth images render at `640x480` in the browser
- Follow-up fix:
  - depth initially appeared pinned to `frame 0`
  - root cause was time-base mismatch: depth sidecar timestamps are absolute epoch seconds, while the viewer playback clock is episode-relative seconds
  - normalized depth timestamps to the episode-relative clock before nearest-frame selection
  - re-verified with Playwright on:
    - `local/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_depth_eval/episode_0?t=5`
    - both depth cards now advance correctly to `frame 100`
- Kept the existing RGB video player unchanged; depth is rendered as an extra synchronized section in the Episodes tab rather than being forced through the MP4 path.

### Depth preview video follow-up

- The browser-side PNG16 decode path was functionally correct but not operationally good:
  - initial depth load was slower than the RGB cards
  - stepping during playback visibly glitched because each frame required parquet read + PNG decode + colorization on the client
- Switched the viewing path to a cleaner split:
  - keep `depth/` as the canonical lossless sidecar
  - generate `depth_preview/` MP4 companions during conversion for the UI only
- The preview colorization now mirrors the default `realsense-viewer` path:
  - source logic: `librealsense::colorizer`
  - visual preset: `Dynamic`
  - color scheme: `Jet`
  - histogram equalization: enabled
  - zero depth: black
- Implemented the same cumulative-histogram + Jet lookup logic in `convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py` and wrote preview videos per depth field.
- Simplified `DepthStreamViewer` in `lerobot-dataset-visualizer` to stop decoding `png16_bytes` in the browser:
  - it now follows passive time-synced preview videos instead of doing per-frame depth rendering on the client
  - removed the `fast-png` dependency from the visualizer
- Validation:
  - converted `episode-20260321-120141` into `spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_depth_preview_eval`
  - generated:
    - `depth_preview/observation.depth.scene/chunk-000/file-000.mp4`
    - `depth_preview/observation.depth.wrist/chunk-000/file-000.mp4`
  - Playwright screenshot confirmed the visualizer renders the new depth preview section on:
    - `local/spark_multisensor_lightning_tactile_depth_preview_eval/episode_0?t=5`

### Teleop runtime refactor spec

- Wrote [teleop-runtime-refactor-spec.md](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/docs/teleop-runtime-refactor-spec.md) to define the next cleanup as a behavior-preserving internal refactor, not a teleop redesign.
- Locked phase-1 scope to the actual core runtime:
  - Spark serial input
  - UR dashboard / RTDE control / RTDE state / gripper
  - Spark teleop orchestration
  - Tk GUI and ROS as adapters on top
- Explicitly marked these as out of phase 1:
  - SpaceMouse
  - VR
  - haptic gloves
  - WebRTC
  - legacy camera publishers under `TeleopSoftware/camera`
- Froze the important current hardware behaviors as requirements:
  - base-joint `±2π` wrap reconciliation on Spark mode entry
  - arm-specific Spark gripper normalization
  - FT zero on enable rising edge
  - current UR mode-transition stop behavior
  - current stamped `/spark/<arm>/teleop/cmd_*` topic surface

### Teleop runtime refactor slice 1: Spark adapter extraction

- Started implementation with the safest isolated slice: the Spark serial path only.
- Added [spark_runtime.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/Spark/spark_runtime.py) to hold the internal Spark runtime pieces that were previously embedded in `SparkNode.py`:
  - `SparkRuntimeConfig`
  - `SparkPacket`
  - `SparkSample`
  - `SparkAngleUnwrapper`
  - `SparkSerialTransport`
  - `SparkDeviceRunner`
- Kept [SparkNode.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/Spark/SparkNode.py) as the same script entrypoint and the same ROS topic publisher surface:
  - `Spark_angle/<id>` or `Spark_angle_buffer/<id>`
  - `Spark_enable/<id>`
- Preserved the important current behavior in this first extraction:
  - same baudrate and timeout defaults
  - same ESP32 boot-settle delay
  - same waiting loop for first valid JSON packet
  - same offsets-pickle lookup by device ID
  - same disconnect/reconnect retry loop
  - same angle unwrapping math
- Added one small robustness improvement while keeping behavior aligned:
  - malformed JSON packets and malformed packet payloads are skipped inside the transport instead of leaking mixed parsing logic into the ROS node
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile TeleopSoftware/Spark/SparkNode.py TeleopSoftware/Spark/spark_runtime.py`
  - parity check against the legacy unwrap math over randomized samples:
    - `spark unwrap parity ok`

### Teleop runtime refactor slice 2: typed launch config and UR adapters

- Added [teleop_runtime_config.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/teleop_runtime_config.py) as a typed boundary for the currently hardcoded Teleop launch-time values:
  - arm order
  - robot IPs
  - enable-control flags
  - enable-gripper flags
  - arm home joint configurations
- Updated [launch.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/launch.py) to read those values from the typed config instead of embedding them inline.
- Added [ur_adapters.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/UR/ur_adapters.py) so the internal UR connection types are now explicit:
  - dashboard adapter
  - RTDE control adapter
  - RTDE state adapter
  - gripper adapter
- Updated [arms.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/UR/arms.py) to use those adapters internally while preserving the existing `UR` class surface used by:
  - `launch.py`
  - `launch_helpers/run.py`
  - `launch_helpers/tk_functions.py`
  - `launch_helpers/opt.py`
- The point of this slice was structural only:
  - keep the same `UR(...)` entrypoint
  - keep the same movement/mode methods
  - keep the same startup behavior contract
  - stop exposing raw third-party client creation directly in multiple places
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile TeleopSoftware/teleop_runtime_config.py TeleopSoftware/UR/ur_adapters.py TeleopSoftware/UR/arms.py TeleopSoftware/launch.py`
  - config smoke check:
    - arm names remain `['Lightning', 'Thunder']`
    - IPs remain `['10.33.55.90', '10.33.55.89']`
    - enable-control map remains unchanged
- Important note:
  - this slice has syntax/config validation only
  - it still needs live hardware parity validation before treating it as fully proven

### Teleop runtime refactor slice 3: extract core Spark orchestration

- Added [teleop_runtime_core.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/teleop_runtime_core.py) to hold the core Spark/UR orchestration logic that had been embedded directly inside `launch_helpers/run.py`.
- Moved these behaviors into the new core module without changing their semantics:
  - stamped robot-state message construction
  - stamped teleop-command message construction
  - periodic stable robot-state publishing
  - Spark mode processing
  - Spark mode visualization math for the Tk plot
  - base-joint wrap reconciliation on mode entry
  - arm-specific gripper normalization
  - FT zero on enable rising edge
- Updated [run.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/run.py) so it now delegates the hot Spark path to the new core module while leaving the other legacy branches in place:
  - SpaceMouse
  - VR
  - Force
- Preserved one especially important current quirk exactly as-is:
  - the Spark path still keys enable gating off `lightning_spark_enable` for both arms
  - this is intentional current hardware behavior because one shared foot pedal gates both arms through the Lightning enable topic
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile TeleopSoftware/teleop_runtime_core.py TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/run.py`
  - parity-oriented Spark smoke check under ROS + `.venv`:
    - exercised base-joint wrap reconciliation
    - exercised FT zero on enable rising edge
    - exercised stamped teleop command publishing
    - result: `spark mode parity smoke ok`
- Important note:
  - like the previous slice, this is still not a substitute for live hardware parity validation

### Teleop runtime refactor slice 4: extract Tk callback controller

- Added [teleop_runtime_controller.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/teleop_runtime_controller.py) so the Tk button callbacks now delegate into a small controller module instead of owning the runtime behavior directly inside `launch_helpers/tk_functions.py`.
- Moved these callback behaviors into the new controller layer:
  - dashboard connect
  - arm connect
  - reset e-stop
  - free-drive toggle
  - gripper toggle
  - home
  - emergency stop
  - SpaceMouse invert toggle
  - FT zero
  - FT home helper
- Replaced [tk_functions.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/tk_functions.py) with a thin compatibility wrapper that:
  - exports the same callback names
  - exports the same `freedrive`, `gripper`, and `buttons` globals expected by `launch.py`
  - forwards all behavior into the new controller module
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile TeleopSoftware/teleop_runtime_controller.py TeleopSoftware/launch_helpers/tk_functions.py`
  - ROS-path import smoke test under `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash` confirmed the wrapper still exports:
    - `freedrive`
    - `gripper`
    - `buttons`
    - `db_connect`
    - `connect_fun`
    - `home_fun`
    - `zero_ft`
- Important note:
  - this slice is still internal only
  - the Tk GUI call signatures and expected globals were preserved intentionally

### Teleop runtime refactor slice 5: extract ROS adapter

- Added [teleop_ros_adapter.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/teleop_ros_adapter.py) so the ROS-facing surface of the Teleop GUI is no longer embedded directly in `launch.py`.
- Moved the core ROS boilerplate behind the adapter:
  - publisher creation for the current raw and stamped robot/teleop topics
  - SpaceMouse log/data subscriptions
  - Spark angle/enable subscriptions
  - the small callbacks that feed `ros_data`
- Updated [launch.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/launch.py) so it now:
  - instantiates `TeleopROSAdapter`
  - asks it to create publishers
  - asks it to register the core subscriptions
  - no longer owns the raw callback methods itself
- This was still a behavior-preserving extraction:
  - same topic names
  - same publisher construction
  - same `ros_data` keys used downstream by `run.py`
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile TeleopSoftware/teleop_ros_adapter.py TeleopSoftware/launch.py`
  - ROS import smoke under the actual Teleop runtime path:
    - `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && .venv/bin/python ...`
    - confirmed the adapter exports callable `create_publishers` and `register_core_subscriptions`

### Operator console state fix after failed conversion

- Found a real console state bug after a failed conversion:
  - `converter.state == failed` was still being treated as if the session were active
  - that left `Start Session` disabled even after `Stop Session`
- Updated [operator_console_qt.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py) so session buttons key off live processes only:
  - `running`
  - `starting`
  - `stopping`
- Failed `recorder` or `converter` states no longer block starting a fresh session.
- Updated [operator_console_backend.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py) so `stop_session()` clears stale validation state, which prevents the UI from implying the old preflight result still applies after all services were shut down.
- Also made failed convert/record exits set `last_action_error` more explicitly:
  - `Convert failed.`
  - `Recording failed.`
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py data_pipeline/operator_console_qt.py`

### Teleop-activity mask for published conversion

- The earlier command-only trimming/alignment policy was not enough once the operator intentionally released the shared foot pedal mid-demo.
- Added a profile-level `teleop_activity` contract to:
  - [multisensor_20hz.yaml](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/configs/multisensor_20hz.yaml)
  - [multisensor_20hz_lightning.yaml](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/configs/multisensor_20hz_lightning.yaml)
  - [multisensor_20hz_thunder.yaml](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/configs/multisensor_20hz_thunder.yaml)
- Current hardware contract uses:
  - `/Spark_enable/lightning`
  - one shared foot pedal gates both arms
- Raw recording now treats that topic as required for new captures via the profile resolver path in:
  - [pipeline_utils.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/pipeline_utils.py)
- Published conversion now:
  - parses the raw Boolean activity topic
  - treats it as a zero-order-held activity signal until the next sample
  - removes pedal-off spans from the published frame grid
  - keeps the existing action-hold bound for active spans
  - does not split one raw episode into multiple published episodes
- Older raw episodes that predate this signal still fall back to the previous behavior and may still fail on long mid-episode command gaps.
- Updated the written contracts in:
  - [raw-storage.md](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/docs/raw-storage.md)
  - [topic-contract.md](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/docs/topic-contract.md)
  - [dataset-mapping.md](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/docs/dataset-mapping.md)
  - [V1_SPEC.md](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/V1_SPEC.md)
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile data_pipeline/pipeline_utils.py data_pipeline/record_episode.py data_pipeline/convert_episode_bag_to_lerobot.py data_pipeline/operator_console_backend.py`
  - synthetic alignment smoke test confirmed a mid-episode pedal-off gap is removed from the published grid instead of becoming an action-hold failure

### Viewer toolchain diagnosis on this machine

- Confirmed the repeated viewer-start failure was not a dataset conversion issue.
- Root cause on this machine was an incomplete frontend build toolchain:
  - `bun` was installed
  - `node` / `npm` were not installed initially
  - the visualizer could be left with a partial `.next/` tree that existed on disk but did not contain a valid production build marker
  - specifically, [`.next/BUILD_ID`](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/lerobot-dataset-visualizer/.next/BUILD_ID) was missing while `bun start` still tried to launch `next start`
- Installed the missing system Node toolchain:
  - `nodejs`
  - `npm`
- Rebuilt the visualizer under the real Node/Next path:
  - `npx next build`
  - later reconfirmed `bun run build` also succeeds now that `node` exists
- Verified the production build is now valid:
  - [`.next/BUILD_ID`](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/lerobot-dataset-visualizer/.next/BUILD_ID) exists
  - `next start` no longer fails with `Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory`
- Also confirmed a separate debugging trap on this machine:
  - shell-level `curl http://localhost:3000/...` probes can return `503 DNS lookup failed` if proxy environment variables are still active
  - those failures were not coming from the viewer itself
  - local probes must clear proxy variables, for example with:
    - `env -u http_proxy -u https_proxy -u HTTP_PROXY -u HTTPS_PROXY -u ALL_PROXY -u all_proxy -u NO_PROXY -u no_proxy curl ...`
- With the rebuilt production bundle and proxy-clean local probes, the viewer serves local datasets correctly again.

### End-to-end parity check after Teleop runtime refactor

- Used real hardware episode [episode-20260321-224016](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/raw_episodes/episode-20260321-224016) as the post-refactor parity check.
- Raw capture manifest confirms the expected newer pipeline behavior:
  - `git_commit: 2e20f2f...`
  - `bag_storage_id: mcap`
  - `bag_storage_preset_profile: zstd_fast`
  - `/Spark_enable/lightning` recorded
  - post-record raw trim applied with policy `teleop_command_head_tail_v1`
- Raw trim outcome for this episode:
  - bag size reduced from `1,599,275,662` bytes to `839,951,373` bytes
  - message count reduced from `32,153` to `17,272`
  - trimmed interval retained the teleop-active span plus `1.0s` pad before/after
- Published conversion for the same episode succeeded:
  - [conversion_summary.json](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/published/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1/meta/spark_conversion/episode-20260321-224016/conversion_summary.json)
  - `status: pass`
  - `dataset_episode_index: 1`
  - `published_frame_count: 332`
- Alignment diagnostics for this successful run are healthy:
  - action hold max age on both teleop command topics: `33.824998 ms`
  - `num_frames_over_50ms: 0`
  - `num_frames_over_100ms: 0`
  - state max alignment error: `11.37 ms`
  - RGB/depth max skew stayed below the `25 ms` policy
- Teleop activity masking was recorded but did not need to remove any mid-episode spans here:
  - one continuous active interval
  - `inactive_removed_duration_s: 0.0`
  - `grid_frame_count_before_filter == grid_frame_count_after_filter == 332`
- Depth publication also worked on the same real episode:
  - sidecars written under:
    - [depth/observation.depth.wrist/chunk-000/file-001.parquet](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/published/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1/depth/observation.depth.wrist/chunk-000/file-001.parquet)
    - [depth/observation.depth.scene/chunk-000/file-001.parquet](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/published/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1/depth/observation.depth.scene/chunk-000/file-001.parquet)
  - preview videos written under:
    - [depth_preview/observation.depth.wrist/chunk-000/file-001.mp4](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/published/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1/depth_preview/observation.depth.wrist/chunk-000/file-001.mp4)
    - [depth_preview/observation.depth.scene/chunk-000/file-001.mp4](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/published/spark_multisensor_lightning_v1/depth_preview/observation.depth.scene/chunk-000/file-001.mp4)
- Conclusion:
  - the current Teleop refactor slices did not break the Lightning single-arm record/convert/view path on this checked episode
  - the remaining work should stay focused on real issues found in use, not more speculative refactor

### `launch_devs.py` cleanup into a Spark-first launcher

- Refactored [launch_devs.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/launch_devs.py) into a thin wrapper over a new typed launcher module:
  - [teleop_device_launcher.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/teleop_device_launcher.py)
- The new module separates:
  - USB discovery
  - SPARK child-process command construction
  - optional legacy SpaceMouse / VR launch behavior
- This keeps the same entrypoint and default bring-up shape for current use:
  - `python TeleopSoftware/launch_devs.py`
  - SPARK devices are still auto-discovered from cp210x serial devices
  - legacy SpaceMouse / VR auto-launch remains available by default for compatibility
- Added an explicit deterministic option for future bring-up:
  - `--spark-device /dev/...`
  - may be passed multiple times
- Added explicit CLI flags so legacy peripherals no longer dictate the structure of the launcher:
  - `--no-space-mouse`
  - `--no-vr`
  - `--buffered-spark-topic`
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile TeleopSoftware/teleop_device_launcher.py TeleopSoftware/launch_devs.py`
  - `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && .venv/bin/python TeleopSoftware/launch_devs.py --help`

### Normalize stable gripper state to `0..1`

- Updated [teleop_runtime_core.py](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/teleop_runtime_core.py) so the stable published gripper state topic:
  - `/spark/{arm}/robot/gripper_state`
  - now uses calibrated normalized opening instead of the raw Robotiq `POS` register
- Semantic contract is now:
  - `0.0 = fully open`
  - `1.0 = fully closed`
- Raw legacy/debug topic remains unchanged:
  - `/{arm}_gripper` still publishes the hardware-native integer position
- Normalization uses the Robotiq driver's calibrated open/closed endpoints established during activation:
  - [get_open_position()](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/UR/gripper.py#L204)
  - [get_closed_position()](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/TeleopSoftware/UR/gripper.py#L208)
- Updated the topic and dataset contract docs so published gripper state and command are explicitly on the same `0..1` scale.

### Episode manifest redesign

- Reworked `episode_manifest.json` into the single resolved per-episode snapshot instead of spreading episode truth across a manifest plus a separate topic-ledger file.
- Kept the profile YAML as the reusable static policy artifact and moved the per-episode resolved topic contract into the manifest itself under:
  - `recorded_topics`
- New manifest shape is now:
  - `manifest_schema_version`
  - `episode`
  - `profile`
  - `capture`
  - `sensors`
  - `recorded_topics`
  - `provenance`
- This replaces the older weaker top-level summary fields:
  - `topics`
  - `topic_types`
- Each `recorded_topics` entry now carries the resolved per-topic snapshot for that episode:
  - message type
  - producer/process provenance
  - semantic meaning and units
  - timestamp carrier and timestamp meaning
  - expected rate band
  - associated `sensor_id` when applicable
  - usage flags like `required_for_record`, `required_for_convert`, `published`, `raw_only`, and `published_fields`
- The intent is to make one episode folder self-describing without adding another machine-readable artifact to maintain.
- Validation:
  - `python3 -m py_compile` passed for the recorder, dummy generator, converter, manifest helpers, and eval script after the schema change
  - a dummy episode generated successfully with the new schema
  - the converter successfully consumed that new manifest and wrote a published episode

### Session-capture architecture direction

- Did a deeper architecture pass on why the current setup feels rigid around:
  - `wrist` / `scene`
  - single left GelSight assumptions
  - using published-profile YAMLs too early in session bring-up
- Wrote [session-capture-plan.md](/home/srinivas/Desktop/pipeline/data_pipeline/docs/session-capture-plan.md) as the architecture decision document for the next layer of redesign.
- The core separation is now explicit:
  - shared contract
  - session capture plan
  - published profile
  - optional local YAML overlays
- Key decisions:
  - canonical role names must stay lab-stable and shared
  - raw session bring-up should be device-centric and role-based
  - published profile YAMLs should remain fixed conversion schemas, not the thing that defines the whole live session
  - optional local YAMLs may provide serial-to-role defaults, launch defaults, calibration refs, UI defaults, optional geometry, and other local rig facts
  - operator confirmation should happen once per session, not once per episode
- This is a design/spec pass only. No runtime behavior was changed yet.
