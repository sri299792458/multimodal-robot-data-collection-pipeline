# Data Pipeline V2 Spec

## Goal

V2 is the new canonical data-collection contract for `data_pipeline/`.

It keeps the same high-level pipeline shape:

- raw recording as one rosbag per episode
- one resolved `episode_manifest.json` per episode
- offline conversion into fixed-schema published datasets

But it changes the sensor/topic model decisively:

- V2 uses canonical role-based raw topic names
- session setup is separated from published-profile selection
- no V1 topic aliases or compatibility shims are part of the target design

Current implementation status:

- V2 is the authoritative target contract
- the runtime and conversion code are still mid-migration
- when code and spec disagree, future implementation should move toward V2 rather than preserving V1 aliases


## Authority

These files are the authoritative V2 contract:

- [V2_SPEC.md](./V2_SPEC.md)
- [docs/topic-contract.md](./docs/topic-contract.md)
- [docs/session-capture-plan.md](./docs/session-capture-plan.md)

The operator-console behavior spec is:

- [docs/operator-console-spec.md](./docs/operator-console-spec.md)

Historical V1 material is archive-only and must not be used to justify new fallback paths.


## Boundary

- `TeleopSoftware/` remains the runtime producer of robot and teleop data.
- `data_pipeline/` owns:
  - recording
  - manifests
  - session planning
  - conversion
  - validation
- new pipeline work must target the V2 topic contract directly
- do not add new V1 aliases such as:
  - `/spark/cameras/wrist/...`
  - `/spark/cameras/scene/...`
  - `/spark/tactile/left/...`
  - `/spark/tactile/right/...`


## Core Objects

### Shared Contract

The shared contract defines:

- canonical topic names
- timestamp meanings
- canonical role names
- dataset-facing field semantics

It is lab-wide and must not vary by operator.

### Session Capture Plan

The session capture plan defines:

- discovered devices
- enabled devices
- resolved canonical roles
- resolved raw topics for this session
- applied local overlays
- published-profile compatibility

It is session-level state, not episode-level repetition.

### Published Profile

A published profile defines a fixed shared dataset schema:

- which canonical raw topics are required
- which canonical raw topics are optional
- how raw topics map into published fields
- alignment rules and thresholds

It is used for conversion, not for deciding which devices are allowed to exist in a session.

### Local Overlay

A local overlay is optional machine- or operator-local metadata, for example:

- serial-to-role defaults
- enabled-by-default flags
- display labels
- mount metadata
- calibration references
- optional geometry files or matrices
- launch defaults

It may add local facts. It must not redefine shared meaning.


## Canonical Raw Topic Surface

V2 raw recording uses only the canonical role-based surface.

### Robot and command topics

- `/spark/{arm}/robot/joint_state`
- `/spark/{arm}/robot/eef_pose`
- `/spark/{arm}/robot/tcp_wrench`
- `/spark/{arm}/robot/gripper_state`
- `/spark/{arm}/teleop/cmd_joint_state`
- `/spark/{arm}/teleop/cmd_gripper_state`

Where `{arm}` is one of:

- `lightning`
- `thunder`

### Session activity topic

V2 uses one shared teleop-activity topic:

- `/spark/session/teleop_active`

This is a raw conversion aid, not the published action.

### Camera topics

V2 camera topics use:

- `/spark/cameras/{attachment}/{camera_slot}/color/image_raw`
- `/spark/cameras/{attachment}/{camera_slot}/depth/image_rect_raw`

Where:

- `{attachment}` is one of:
  - `lightning`
  - `thunder`
  - `world`
- `{camera_slot}` is a canonical slot name such as:
  - `wrist_1`
  - `scene_1`
  - `scene_2`
  - `scene_3`

Examples:

- `/spark/cameras/lightning/wrist_1/color/image_raw`
- `/spark/cameras/lightning/wrist_1/depth/image_rect_raw`
- `/spark/cameras/world/scene_1/color/image_raw`
- `/spark/cameras/world/scene_1/depth/image_rect_raw`

### Tactile topics

V2 tactile topics use:

- `/spark/tactile/{arm}/{finger_slot}/color/image_raw`
- `/spark/tactile/{arm}/{finger_slot}/depth/image_raw`
- `/spark/tactile/{arm}/{finger_slot}/marker_offset`

Where `{finger_slot}` is one of:

- `finger_left`
- `finger_right`

Examples:

- `/spark/tactile/lightning/finger_left/color/image_raw`
- `/spark/tactile/lightning/finger_right/depth/image_raw`
- `/spark/tactile/thunder/finger_left/marker_offset`


## Raw Recording Rules

- one demo = one raw episode = one rosbag
- the raw bag stores canonical V2 topics only
- one session may record multiple episodes under one resolved session plan
- pedal-off spans are represented by the session activity topic, not by fake action holds
- the raw layer remains the source of truth


## Episode Manifest

`episode_manifest.json` remains the single resolved per-episode snapshot.

Its top-level sections stay:

- `manifest_schema_version`
- `episode`
- `session`
- `profile`
- `capture`
- `sensors`
- `recorded_topics`
- `provenance`

The important V2 change is that `recorded_topics` and `sensors.devices` must reflect canonical V2 raw topics and canonical V2 roles.


## Published Profiles

Published profiles in V2 must refer directly to canonical V2 raw topics.

That means:

- they map from role-based raw topics
- they do not use V1 shorthand camera/tactile names
- they do not define session bring-up

The active `multisensor_20hz*.yaml` files are now part of the V2 profile layer and must continue to point directly at canonical V2 raw topics.


## Timestamp Rule

V2 keeps the existing timestamp meanings unless a later spec changes them explicitly:

- `host_capture_time_v1`
- `control_tick_time_v1`
- `command_issue_time_v1`

The naming stays for now because the semantics are unchanged. V2 changes the topic/role model, not the clock meanings.


## Migration Rule

From this point on:

- V2 is the only target contract
- do not add dual V1/V2 code paths
- do not add legacy alias topics
- do not let the UI, session plan, profiles, and topic contract disagree about canonical names

If a new change does not satisfy the V2 topic contract directly, it is the wrong change.
